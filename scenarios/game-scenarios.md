# Game Scenarios

## Targets of Opportunity

Some key objectives have been detected inside a small landing area at the heart of the warzone. Your aim is to enter these zones, find and seize the objectives, and extract them before the enemy has a chance to do the same!

**Army**

* 2-4 players.

**Setup**

* 4' x4' board.

**Deployment**

* Opposite board edges. 2 players shown in blue, 3-4 players shown in yellow.
* All units begin In Readiness.

**Duration**

* 6 rounds.

**Victory Conditions**

3 Hidden Mobile Objectives placed along the centre line of the board (shown in green as examples). When playing with 3-4 players or in a Battle add 4 more Hidden Mobile Objectives (shown in orange as examples).

Each Objective scores 1 Victory Point to the player holding it at the end of the game.

If a squad carrying an Objective ends its activation with at least 1 unit within 1" of their friendly board edge, remove them from the game and place them In Readiness. The Objective is removed and instead scores 2 Victory Points for that player at the end of the game.

This scenario works best with plenty of scenery.

It s recommended that every Objective be placed within a Garrison, although it can be played in a more open environment with a few forests or sparse bunkers to protect the Objectives.

**Variant: "Primary Target"**

In this scenario, the centre objective is worth twice as many Victory Points, and should be placed in a large Garrison - the bigger the better!

## Battle Royale

Armies are about to clash and your orders are refreshingly simple - annihilate the enemy! Rapidly occupying the best ground will be instrumental in securing victory. Lock and load!

**Army**

* 2-4 players.

**Setup**

* 4' x4' board.
* 1 large Garrison in the centre of the board (shown in green as example).
* 2 large Garrisons at least 12" from board edges (shown in purple as examples).
* When playing with 3-4 players or in a Battle, add 2 extra large Garrisons (shown in orange as examples).

**Deployment**

Opposite board edges. 2 players shown in blue, 3-4 players shown in yellow. All units begin In Readiness.

**Duration**

6 rounds.

**Victory Conditions**

The player with the most Kill Points at the end of the game wins. Special Rules

* **Vantage Point:** Infantry units firing out of the large Garrisons double their R(F) and R(C) values.

**Variant: "Military Complex"**

The secondary Garrisons are linked with the centre Garrison, and more are added, making a sprawling complex for Infantry to fight through. Entire sections of the complex can be destroyed from the outside, meaning Infantry will need constant support to move through and purge the enemy.

## Bunker Assault

The enemy is taking hold of key planetary defences, and it is your mission to take and hold a bunker complex linked to an orbital laser. This is a high value target to capture - be prepared for enemy contact!

**Army**

* 2-4 players.

**Setup**

* 4' x4' board.
* 3 Garrisons , one in the centre of the board and two others in opposite quarters (shown in green as examples).
* When playing with 3-4 players or in a Battle, add 2 extra Garrisons (shown in orange as examples).

**Deployment**

Within 12" of opposite board corners. 2 players shown in blue, 3-4 players shown in yellow.

All units begin either Directly Deployed or In Readiness.

**Duration**

6 rounds.

**Victory Conditions**

Each listed Garrison contains one Open Objective worth 1 Victory Point.

For each listed Garrison, the player with the highest number of points of units within 6 scores 2 Victory Points. Infantry units inside the Garrison are worth double their points. If the Garrisons are destroyed, this condition is instead worth only 1 Victory Point (replace the Garrison with Tough scenery as normal).

The Garrisons in this scenario should be Medium or Large Bunkers, as listed in the Features section.

**Variant: "Hive Assault"**

Garrisons lose the Destructible rule, meaning they will always last until the end of the game. This makes for a more fierce fight.

## Survey and Control

Careful intelligence gathering and sector by sector control is necessary in this area - sweeping ground and finding out what the enemy has planned is top priority for headquarters.

**Army**

* 2 players.

**Setup**

* 4' x4' board.
* 5-10 Garrisons in a Skirmish. 10-15 Garrisons in a Clash.
* 15-20 Garrisons in a Battle.

**Deployment**

* Opposite board edges (in blue). All units begin In Readiness.

**Duration**

* 6 rounds.

**Victory Conditions**

Each Garrison contains 1 Open Objective. When a unit claims each Objective, roll on the table below.

|Dice Roll|Effect|
| :-: | :- |
|1|Booby Trap: Score 1 Victory Point. The Garrison suffers D6 automatic Energy 9 hits.|
|2-5|Intelligence: Score 1 Victory Point.|
|6|Critical Location: Score 1 Victory Point and place an Open Objective in the Garrison, automatically claimed by the unit. The player with the highest number of points of units within 6" of this Objective scores 1 additional Victory Point at the end of the game.|

**Variant: "Stop the Clock"**

This version best represents a vicious commander that has rigged a city with explosives (such as Salakahn), with opposing forces looking to find a way to avert (or encourage) the destruction. The setup is the same, but the Objective table is changed to be more dangerous!

|Dice Roll|Effect|
| :-: | :- |
|1|Big Boom: The Garrison is destroyed.|
|2-5|Boom: Score 1 Victory Point. The Garrison suffers 2D6 automatic Energy 9 hits.|
|6|Tick Tick Tick: Score 1 Victory Point and modify the next roll on this table (friendly or enemy) by up to 3.|
