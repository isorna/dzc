# Deployment

Deployment zones are different for each scenario, and although distances are specified, it may be worth changing the zones if you change the size of board you re playing on.

After setting up scenery, each player rolls a dice, re-rolling any ties. The player with the highest score picks a deployment zone, followed by the next highest and so on.

The scenario will specify if and how many Battlegroups are Directly Deployed, In Readiness, or In Reserve.

After picking a deployment zone, the player with the highest roll chooses a Battlegroup to deploy, followed by the next highest player and so on, cycling through players until all Battlegroups have been deployed. **Any unit that can be embarked in a Transport may choose to be before the game starts, meaning that the Transport deploys with the rest of the Battlegroup.**

Other Auxiliary squads can be deployed as part of a Battlegroup, or deployed all together after all other Battlegroups.

When deploying a Battlegroup, all units in that Battlegroup must be deployed in the same way. A Battlegroup cannot split its squads between In Readiness and In Reserve for example. Declare for each Battlegroup (according to the scenario rules) when you pick them to deploy.

### Directly Deployed

Battlegroups that are Directly Deployed are placed anywhere in their own deployment zone, not on scenery pieces they cannot move across, with all units in coherency within their squads.

### In Readiness

Battlegroups that are deployed In Readiness are waiting just outside of the table. Inform your opponents that the Battlegroup is In Readiness. These Battlegroups can be activated during a round like any other Battlegroup. In that activation, all units must make a Moving action measured from any board edge inside their deployment zone. You can choose to not activate an In Readiness Battlegroup, in which case it will remain In Readiness until the next round.

### In Reserve

Battlegroups that are deployed In Reserve are slow to arrive to the battlefield. Inform your opponents that the Battlegroup is In Reserve. Battlegroups In Reserve may not complete actions until the scenario specifies they can move out of being In Reserve.

If not specified in the scenario, units in Reserve automatically move to In Readiness at the end of the first round.
