# Objectives

An Objective is a catch-all name for something that your army will generally need to discover, capture, or extract from the combat zone in order to win the game. Objectives could be valuable pieces of intel, technology, or strategic points - all operate in the same way.

**Objectives are best represented by small, double-sided tokens, 30mm in diameter.** Measure to the centre of the token as normal.

Objectives are set up on the board after scenery is setup but before deployment. Unless otherwise stated, players take turns to place Objectives. Objectives can be found in many places, including forests, buildings, road intersections, and even wrecked vehicles. When placing Objectives they may be placed anywhere on the battlefield at least 6" away from any board edge or from each other. They may be placed inside Garrisons - simply put the token on top of the Garrison. **If an Objective that isn't being carried is in a Garrison that is destroyed, the Objective is removed from the game.** Objectives inside Garrisons may only be interacted with by a unit inside that same Garrison.

Objectives have several special rules that can be used in any combination in a scenario.

### Open Objectives

These Objectives are easy to see and obtain. If a friendly Infantry or Vehicle unit **in coherency** is **within 2" of the Objective or in the same Garrison as it, they claim the Objective.** Objectives can be reclaimed by other players if they meet those criteria and there are no enemy units that also meet that criteria.

Unless otherwise noted, all Objectives not in Garrisons are Open Objectives.

### Hidden Objectives

These Objectives are harder to find, even if a commander knows their general location. A Hidden Objective must be discovered. Unless otherwise noted, all Objectives in Garrisons are Hidden Objectives.

A friendly Infantry or Vehicle squad **in coherency** with at least 1 unit **within 2"** of a Hidden Objective or in the same Garrison as a Hidden Objective may make a special **search action,** counting as **both** of their actions for the round. A Hidden Objective in a Garrison may only be searched for by squads in the same Garrison.

When searching, **roll 1 dice for the squad** searching. If there are **enemy units within 2" or in the same Garrison,** the dice roll is modified by **-1.** Add the resulting number to the number of the current round. **If the result is 7 or more,** the Objective permanently becomes an Open Objective and the unit claims it.

A Transport that doesn't have the Aircraft type may choose to make a scan action, counting as both of its actions for the round. Place a **Scan Token** by the unit. Before a squad makes a search roll, you may **remove any friendly Scan Tokens within 2" to add +1 to the search roll per token.** If the searching unit is in a Garrison, measure the distance to any edge of the Garrison. If the Transport makes a Moving action, remove its Scan Token. **A unit may only have 1 Scan Token at a time.**

### Mobile Objectives

Mobile Objectives can be picked up and moved. This will stop an enemy getting the Objective, and some scenarios will even call for Objectives to be extracted from the board.

If a Mobile Objective has been **claimed** by an Infantry or Vehicle unit, their squad automatically counts as carrying it. The Objective is moved with the squad. Only Infantry or Vehicle squads may carry Objectives, but they may in turn embark into non-Vehicle units such as Aircraft.

**A squad may only carry one Objective at any time.**

Mobile Objectives can be passed to another friendly Infantry or Vehicle squad (even from another squad or Battlegroup) if any units are within 2" of each other at any point during either of their activations. If a squad is in a Garrison, they **cannot pass** an Objective to a squad outside of that same Garrison. Equally a squad outside a Garrison **cannot pass** an Objective to a squad inside a Garrison.

A squad can drop an Objective at any time - simply place it within 2" of any unit. If the squad is in a Garrison, the Objective cannot be dropped outside of the Garrison. If the squad is outside of a Garrison it cannot be dropped inside the Garrison. A dropped Objective automatically becomes unclaimed. If a squad is **out of coherency** at the **end** of its activation, or **fails a Fortitude Test,** it **automatically drops any Objective** it was carrying. If an enemy squad is within 1" of this squad or in the same Garrison, they automatically claim it. If more than one opponent has a squad within 1 , the Objective remains unclaimed.

If a squad carrying an Objective is **destroyed,** they drop the Objective before being removed them from the game. **If destroyed by a Close Quarters weapon, that unit claims the Objective automatically instead.** If a squad carrying an Objective is destroyed whilst in an Aircraft, the Objective is destroyed too.
