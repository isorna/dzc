# Aerial Advantage
Aircraft are able to react to dropzones much quicker than conventional ground-based war machines, and commanders are often the first to battle to oversee their forces.

Any Battlegroup that is **not** an HQ Battlegroup or a Battlegroup deployed entirely in Aircraft (including Auxiliary Transports) always starts the game In Reserve, regardless of the scenario rules.

Duration

How many rounds the game lasts for.

Victory Conditions

Games use two methods of determining victory: **Victory Points** and **Kill Points.**

Victory Points are the most important, and are most often earned by capturing Objectives. Victory Points are usually calculated at the end of the game - the player with the most wins.

Kill Points are used to determine who wins in the event of a tie in Victory Points and often generate extra Victory Points of their own. Kill Points are simply the total points value of all destroyed enemy units and Commanders. Damaged units do not count towards Kill Points; they must be destroyed outright to count.
