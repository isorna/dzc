# Unit Types

There are several different types of unit in the game. Unit types determine how far away they can be from each other, how they treat scenery, and there are special rules that apply to different unit types too.

Squads have coherency values - this represents the distance they can be from each other while still maintaining combat efficiency. To be in coherency each unit in a squad must be within their coherency distance of another unit in the squad, creating a single unbroken chain or web connecting every unit in the squad.

Some units have more than one profile with different unit types. These units can transition between different types as part of a Moving action provided they do not move more than half of their MV distance (rounding up). Simply declare which statline the unit is using, provided it is able to be the other type (an Aircraft wouldn't be able to become a Vehicle on top of Impassable terrain for example). Units in a squad must transition together.

## Infantry

_Ground soldiers make up the bulk of most armies, deployed into the field to capture strategic points and fight enemies up close and personal._

Infantry are represented by bases, usually with 3-5 individual infantrymen on a base. For game purposes, the whole base is treated as a single unit, eliminating the need to move fiddly infantry separately.

Infantry units must be within 2" of another unit within their squad to be in coherency.

## Aircraft

_Dropzone battles are fast and frantic, leaving little room for units unable to redeploy rapidly to deal with new threats. Aircraft transport most units to and from the battlefield, and provide air support to vulnerable ground troops._

Aircraft units must be within 6" of another unit within their squad to be in coherency.

**Only weapons with the Anti- Aircraft (AA) special rule may shoot at Aircraft.**

See the Aircraft section for more rules on using Aircraft.

## Behemoths

_The largest weapons ever created for ground- based combat, Behemoths are engines of absolute destruction. Capable of levelling entire cities, these colossi are near impossible to destroy via conventional means._

Behemoths are the biggest and most dangerous vehicles employed on the battlefield, and as such have several rules associated with their use.

See the Behemoth section for more rules on using Behemoths.

## Vehicles

_The most common war engines in the galaxy, from treaded tanks to gravity nullifying skimmers and even walking battlesuits._

Vehicle units must be within 3" of another unit within their squad to be in coherency.

Vehicle units can be further split down into 3 subcategories. Anything that affects Vehicles will affect all of these subcategories, but certain weapons or rules will only affect the subcategories.

### Tanks

Tanks have no additional special rules, although can incorporate wheeled APCs among others.

### Skimmers

Skimmers suffer no penalty to their MV value when moving over Tough terrain, and may move over and onto Impassable scenery up to 2" high.

### Walkers

Walkers suffer no penalty to their MV value when moving over Tough terrain, and may move over Impassable scenery and other units up to half the height of the model (although may not end their movement on top of either).
