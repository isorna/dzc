# Actions
Squads in Dropzone Commander may perform **2 actions** during their activation. There are a few actions to choose from, but the most common are **moving** and **shooting**. Unless otherwise stated, **a squad cannot perform the same action twice in one activation.**

Not all units have to perform actions in a round, but at least 1 unit must perform an action during a Battlegroup s activation.

A squad may complete its actions in any order, but cannot split actions up (for example moving half distance, shooting, then moving the remaining distance).

**Units in a squad must perform the same actions simultaneously,** but different squads in a Battlegroup may perform different actions at different times.
