# Collateral Damage

Burning foliage and falling masonry are just as dangerous to occupying forces as a direct hit from a tank shell. Once a structure starts falling apart, whole floors can give way, and fires in forests spread quicker than troops can escape.

Collateral Damage tokens are always resolved at the start of the Round Up Phase. In addition, if the scenery piece affected is an **occupied Garrison,** the tokens are resolved **immediately** after that Shooting action has been completed.

This includes a Garrison suffering a Critical hit, and Collateral Damage tokens from other places (such as Flame weapons). When a Garrison resolves Collateral Damage in this way, all tokens are resolved simultaneously, regardless of whether they were just placed or already on the Garrison.

Each Collateral Damage token causes **one automatic hit at Energy 4**

**against the scenery piece.** If it s an occupied Garrison, each token also does one automatic hit at Energy 4 to one randomised squad inside. Roll once to randomise and resolve all tokens against that squad.

Body Cover is ignored for Collateral Damage, but Passive Countermeasures can be used as usual. The opposing player allocates damage to a unit in the squad. **Collateral Damage cannot cause Criticals, but automatically damages on a roll of 6.**

If a Collateral Damage hit rolls high enough to damage the scenery piece, it takes 1 damage as normal, and the token is left on to be rolled again at the start of the next round up phase. If the hit doesn t roll high enough to damage the scenery piece (regardless of whether it damages any infantry inside), remove the token.

For example, a Garrison occupied by 2 squads has 4 Collateral Damage tokens. 1 dice is rolled - on a 1-3 they hit Squad A, and 4-6 Squad B. A 3 is rolled, and Squad A and the Garrison suffer 4 Energy 4 hits.

Squad A take 3 damage from their hits, and the Garrison takes 2 damage. 2 Collateral Damage tokens are removed, and 2 are left on.
