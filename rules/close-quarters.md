# Close Quarters

## Close Quarters Weapons & Fortitude

These weapons are denoted by a Range value of CQ, and make a few changes to the standard rules.

Close Quarters weapons require the attacking unit to be in the same Garrison as the target, **and are the only weapons that can be used against a unit in that situation.**

**If a squad chooses to shoot with Close Quarters weapons, it cannot use any other weapon profiles during that activation.**

Close Quarters weapons allocate shots to a **squad** instead of a **unit.**

**Close Quarters weapons automatically hit, but cannot inflict Criticals.**

Damage from a Close Quarters weapon is resolved against a squad, with the most damaged unit losing Damage Points first, or the controlling player deciding if there is a tie.

At the end of a Battlegroup's activation, if an Infantry squad **currently under 50%** of its original total Damage points has taken damage from a Close Quarters weapon during that activation it must make a **Fortitude Test.**

Roll 1 dice and consult their Fortitude.

If the result is equal to or higher than the number, there is no effect. If the result is lower, the squad runs away! The squad must immediately abandon the Garrison or transfer to a linked Garrison. The squad may embark directly into a transport if possible. Squads that fail their Fortitude Test will drop any Objectives they re carrying (see Mobile Objectives for details). This move does not affect a squad's activation in any way.

**A squad that has to make a Fortitude Test can choose to fail it automatically.**
