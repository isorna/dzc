# Moving

Units within a squad may be moved **up to their maximum MV value.** A unit doesn t have to move its full MV, but any remaining distance is lost.

Simply pick a point within the unit s MV and move it there. Unless otherwise noted, units cannot move onto or over other units, however units in the same squad are ignored during movement (although still cannot end their move on another unit).

Units may turn on their axis as much as you want during their movement for no cost to their MV value, but doing so still counts as the unit having moved (this is particularly relevant for the purposes of shooting with some units). Some units have a MV value of 0 . These cannot move but may still turn on their axis.

Movement can be affected by many things (such as scenery), which will be detailed later on.
