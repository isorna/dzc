The Basics

Stat Sheets

Models in Dropzone Commander are referred to as units. Sometimes a unit will be a single battle tank or dropship, and other times it will be a single base of infantry. Each unit in

the game is represented by a stat sheet. These sheets show all sorts of information about the unit s attributes and abilities. It shows their strength, protection, weapons, and even details such as the type of unit it is and the points it costs a player to field them in a game. An example of a stat sheet is shown below.

**All stat sheets can be found at www.dropzonecommander.com**

F

Re-roll successful Collatoral Damage hits against this unit.

A **Category -** This defines the unit s role within a Battlegroup.

B **Transport Options -** This represents if this unit can carry other units and if it

can be carried by other units, as well as how much it can carry and how much space it takes up if it can be carried (see Transports for more details).

C **Name -** The name of the unit.

**Points Cost (Pts) -** Most units in the game cost points to field in your army. Units

with a higher points cost will generally be more potent, but you will not be able to field as many. This number is for a single unit within the squad.

**Move (MV) -** The maximum distance the unit may move. This is listed in inches.

**Countermeasures (CM) -** The type and potency of the Countermeasures utilized

by the unit (see Shooting for more details). Active Countermeasures are denoted by an  A , Passive Countermeasures by a  P  with a number next to it, and Evasion Countermeasures by an  E  with a number next to it.

**Armour (A) -** Represents the resilience of the unit to damage. Higher numbers

represent better protection.

**Damage Points (D) -** The maximum number of damage a unit may sustain

before it is destroyed.

**Type -** The type of unit. Certain special rules apply to certain unit types (such as

when moving through or over scenery). Infantry types will have a number showing their Fortitude.

**Special -** Any special rules which apply to the unit. Any rules listed here are

described in the main rules.

D **Squad Size -** This number represents the allowed number of units in the Squad.

In this example, a Squad consists of 2 Hazard Suit Teams.

E **Weapons -** Any weapons the unit has access to are listed here. A unit may have

multiple weapons, and unless otherwise stated can use them all in a single activation.

F **Extra rules -** Some units have options, such as additional weapons. These are

listed here along with any additional points costs. If a player chooses to pay the points cost, they gain the weapon on the stat sheet. Note that all units in a squad must be armed identically, so if one unit choose to replace its weapons, all units in that squad must also do so. Any special rules unique to the unit are also listed here.

The Golden Rule

Dropzone Commander is a game designed for fun and tense battles. The rules are written to minimise disagreements, but will never be ironclad - particularly in high stakes competitive settings. In situations where it s not immediately obvious how to proceed, always remember the Golden Rule: the object of the game is to win, the point of the game is for both players to have fun.

In a fun game, it s good practice to allow your opponent a little leeway, whether measuring line of sight, planning their actions, or any number of other options that come up during a game. If your opponent wants to do something fun and interesting, put yourself in their shoes - who knows when you ll want to try something equally as daring?

Failing that, if you still can t decide on a way to proceed, roll a dice! It s easier to do that than to spend a long time poring over rules - roll off, then make a note to double-check after the game is over.

[Your Army](#_page39_x0.00_y595.28)[ Rules](#_page41_x0.00_y595.28)

Dice

Dropzone Commander uses 6-sided dice, often referred to as D6. Unless otherwise stated, when instructed to roll a dice, it

will be a D6. Occasionally a D3 dice will also be needed, although it s easy enough to simulate these using D6 (1/2 = 1, 3/4 = 2, 5/6 = 3).

**Often dice will have modifiers to**

**their rolls. A plus penalty (such as a +2 penalty) will increase the number needed to roll, whereas a minus bonus (such as a -1 bonus) will reduce the number needed to roll.**

For example, a weapon suffers a +2 penalty to its 3+ AC value. The player now needs to roll a 5+ to hit with the weapon.

A roll may have multiple modifiers, which are all added or subtracted together. **However, a roll of a 1 is always a failure.**

Sometimes you may be instructed to re-roll dice. **A dice may only ever be re-rolled once.**

Measuring

All distances in the game are measured in inches, noted with inverted commas (for example 6  is 6 inches). You are allowed to measure distances at any time.

Unless otherwise specified, **distance**

**is measured to and from the centre point of a unit.** When measuring, judge the distance from centre to centre, even measuring diagonally, for example when measuring to Aircraft in the air.

Line of Sight

Dropzone Commander uses true line of sight. To check if a unit has line of sight to another unit, draw a straight line between the miniatures. The easiest way to do

this is to get close to the unit itself for a

` `miniature s eye view  of its surroundings. If any part of the main body or base of the target can be seen from the centre point of the main body or base of the unit, it is in line of sight. If only weapons, arms, or legs can be seen for example, it is out of line of sight.

**Units in the same squad (friendly and enemy) are ignored when checking line of sight.**

7

The centre of an Infantry unit s base must be visible for it to be in line of sight (this represents the ability of infantry to hug the terrain and hide just around corners).

How you measure line of sight is up to you. Straight poles and laser pens are commonly used. How precise you are

with line of sight measurements during games is also up to you. Being diligent will improve game accuracy, but may slow the game down - as with most things, it s best to take a balanced approach.

Friendly & Enemy units

Any unit in your army is a friendly unit, and any in opposing armies are enemy units.

When abilities say they affect any or every friendly unit, that does include the unit using the ability, provided they are eligible to be the target.

Units, Squads & Battlegroups

Dropzone categorises miniatures in three ways: units, squads, and Battlegroups. These three categories are used in different ways in many of the rules, so it s important to note the differences between them.

**Units** are a single model, or base of models. Identical **units** band together

to form **squads** - small fighting groups that take to the battle together. **Units within a squad perform actions simultaneously.** If there is only 1 unit in

a squad, it is still counted as a squad for all purposes.

Squads are then formed together into **Battlegroups,** which consist of several different types of units to form a fighting force greater than the sum of its parts.

**Squads in a Battlegroup are activated together.** If there is only 1 squad left

in a Battlegroup, it is still counted as a Battlegroup for all purposes.

Unit Types

There are several different types of unit in the game. Unit types determine how far away they can be from each other, how they treat scenery, and there are special rules that apply to different unit types too.

Squads have coherency values - this represents the distance they can be from each other while still maintaining combat efficiency. To be in coherency each unit in a squad must be within their coherency distance of another unit in the squad, creating a single unbroken chain or web connecting every unit in the squad.

Some units have more than one profile with different unit types. These units can transition between different types

as part of a Moving action provided they do not move more than half of their MV distance (rounding up). Simply declare which statline the unit is using, provided it is able to be the other type (an Aircraft wouldn t be able to become a Vehicle on top of Impassable terrain for example). Units in a squad must transition together.

[Your Army](#_page39_x0.00_y595.28)[ Rules](#_page41_x0.00_y595.28)

Infantry

Ground soldiers make up the bulk of most armies, deployed into the field to capture strategic points and fight enemies up close and personal.

Infantry are represented by bases, usually with 3-5 individual infantrymen on a base. For game purposes, the whole base is treated as a single unit, eliminating the need to move fiddly infantry separately.

Infantry units must be within 2  of another unit within their squad to be in coherency.

Aircraft

Dropzone battles are fast and frantic, leaving little room for units unable to redeploy rapidly to deal with new threats. Aircraft transport most units to and from the battlefield, and provide air support to vulnerable ground troops.

Aircraft units must be within 6  of another unit within their squad to be in coherency.

**Only weapons with the Anti- Aircraft (AA) special rule may shoot at Aircraft.**

See the Aircraft section for more rules on using Aircraft.

Behemoths

The largest weapons ever created for ground- based combat, Behemoths are engines of absolute destruction. Capable of levelling entire cities, these colossi are near impossible to destroy via conventional means.

Behemoths are the biggest and most dangerous vehicles employed on the battlefield, and as such have several rules associated with their use.

See the Behemoth section for more rules on using Behemoths.

Vehicles

The most common war engines in the galaxy, from treaded tanks to gravity nullifying skimmers and even walking battlesuits.

Vehicle units must be within 3  of another unit within their squad to be in coherency.

Vehicle units can be further split down into 3 subcategories. Anything that affects Vehicles will affect all of these subcategories, but certain weapons or rules will only affect the subcategories.

Tanks

Tanks have no additional special rules, although can incorporate wheeled APCs among others.

Skimmers

Skimmers suffer no penalty to their MV value when moving over Tough terrain, and may move over and onto Impassable scenery up to 2  high.

Walkers

Walkers suffer no penalty to their MV value when moving over Tough terrain, and may move over Impassable scenery and other units up to half the height of the model (although may not end their movement on top of either).

[Your Army](#_page39_x0.00_y595.28)[ Rules](#_page41_x0.00_y595.28)

Command

Armies seldom succeed in battle without a good commander. In fluid situations, the actions and decisions of front-line leaders often separate victory from defeat.

Commanders

Commanders cost points in an army.

A player is free to include as many commanders as they wish, and do not have to include any. Although only the highest Command Value is used at a time, special abilities and Command Cards can be played with **any** friendly commander as their source, so having multiple commanders offers more tactical flexibility and redundancy in case of casualties.

A commander must be mounted in a unit with the **Command category or with**

**the Command Centre special rule,** and only one Commander may be mounted in each unit. This is chosen before rolling for deployment, and the commander cannot leave that unit.

Commanders cost points, although never contribute to a Battlegroup s points limit, since they are only mounted in a unit directly before the game. Armies can include any of the following Commanders:



|Command Value|Influence|Points|
| :-: | - | - |
|1|4”|0|
|2|8”|35|
|3|12”|65|
|4|16”|95|
|5|20”|125|
|6|24”|155|
**Command Value -** Command Value is

used for various things, including Command Cards and rolling for Initiative.

**Influence -** This is the distance in inches

a commander is able to use special abilities, such as Command Cards.

**Points -** How many points this

commander costs. Note that a Command Value 1 Commander is free to any unit able to mount a Commander.

Shooting at Commanders

Commanders are prime targets, but are often accompanied by a protective detail.

When a friendly Commander has shots allocated to it, the **controlling player**

may choose to allocate the shots to any other unit in the same squad, provided it

is a valid target, and isn t Hull Down if the Commander isn t Hull Down (see Shooting for details on Hull Down).

Famous Commanders

Famous Commanders are particularly noble or notorious individuals, legendary for their exploits on the battlefield as great leaders.

Each Famous Commander is unique,

so can only be taken **once per army** (although multiple different Famous Commanders may be taken). There s always the possibility that opposing armies could be fielding the same Famous Commander. In this situation the opposing commander is obviously an imposter and should be treated as such!

Famous Commanders follow all the usual rules for Commanders with the exception that they will have a specific mount, usually custom made specially for them. They are always fielded mounted in that unit rather than choosing which unit they are in before the battle. This means that their full points cost counts towards a Battlegroup limit.

[Building ](#_page39_x0.00_y595.28)[ Special ](#_page41_x0.00_y595.28)

Command Cards

Command Cards represent the specific actions and decisions made by a commander.

Command Cards have various different effects, and can be used in all sorts of different situations. The card itself will explain exactly when and how to play it. Each Command Card will have an Area value on it, either Global or Influence. A Global card can be played with no restrictions, but an Influence card can only be played if the target is within

the Influence distance of any friendly Commander.

A player may play as many Command Cards in a round as they wish. Once played, a Command Card is discarded.

At times, more than one player will want to play a Command Card at the same time. Some cards may even explicitly counter others! When this happens, any players wishing to play cards may do so, and only after all players do not want to play any more cards will the effects be resolved

in reverse order (starting from the card last played and moving backwards to the card first played). In some situations one card will cancel out another, or a card will not be able to be resolved because of the effects of another. In these situations the card is still discarded.

A deck of Command Cards is **30 different cards,** chosen by the player at the start of the game, before deployment. There are many different Command Cards to choose from, and some may only be available to certain factions, denoted by the faction s logo on the card itself. The deck of Command Cards is shuffled and then placed face down. Cards are drawn randomly into a player s hand, and kept secret from their opponents.

When Command Cards are discarded, they may not be used again in the game. A commander with a high Command Value will be able to play more Command Cards in a round, but will cycle through those cards quicker, so be sure not to run out of cards before the game is over!

If a commander is killed, you must immediately remove Command Cards in your hand down to the next highest friendly Command Value present on the table. **If there are no friendly Commanders present on the**

**table, you may still have and use 1 Command Card.**

Famous Commanders often come with their own unique Command Cards, which can be added to a deck provided the Famous Commander is used in the battle. These can be used by any commander once the game starts, and stay in the deck even if the Famous Commander unit is destroyed.

Scouts & Command Cards

Scouting forces are often used as command and control relays, and as such any Command Card with an Influence Area can be used within 8  of any unit with the Scout category.

[Your Army](#_page39_x0.00_y595.28)[ Rules](#_page41_x0.00_y595.28)

Rounds & Activations

A game is played out as a series of rounds. The number of rounds in a game will usually depend on the scenario chosen. Each round is split up into several phases:

Phase 1: Initiation

A new round always begins with the initiation phase. The initiation sequence is as follows:

1. Each player **rolls 1 dice** and adds the **highest Command Value** (CV) of a friendly Commander present on the table. The result is the order players activate, with the player with the highest score winning the initiative and going first, the second highest second and so on. If one single player rolls a 6, they **always** count as winning the initiative, but if multiple players roll 6s, add the CV as normal. Re-roll any ties after adding CV. **A player that won the initiative may choose to give the initiative to the second-highest scoring player.**
1. Each player discards any unwanted Command Cards.
1. Each player replenishes the Command Cards in their hand **up to the highest CV** of a friendly Commander present on the table (including those embarked in a Transport), or 1 Command Card if there are no friendly Commanders.
1. Any effects that result from certain special rules may be addressed now.

Phase 2: Battlegroup Activation

The player that was chosen to go first must activate a Battlegroup that hasn t yet been activated. The player must also declare which Auxiliary squads they will be activating with this Battlegroup (see the Building Your Army section for more details).

A player may not choose to skip activating a Battlegroup if it is their turn to do so, and must complete actions with at least 1 unit when activating a Battlegroup.

A Battlegroup with no units able to complete actions (either because they are all in Reserve or destroyed) is ignored and may **not** be activated.

Activating a Battlegroup means that the player can now make actions with any squads in this Battlegroup. **Choose one squad at a time to activate. Complete that squad s actions before moving onto the next.** However, it is often easiest to combine multiple squads  actions, such as units disembarking from transports and moving. In this situation it s always best to offer a little leeway to your opponent in order to speed up the game.

Once the first player has completed all desired actions with this Battlegroup, the next player may activate a Battlegroup, and so on until every Battlegroup has been activated. This will usually involve going through the order of Initiative several times. A player with no more Battlegroups left to activate must wait until the other players have activated all of theirs.

Once all Battlegroups have been activated, move onto Phase 3.

Phase 3: Round Up Winning The Game

Any special rules and effects which apply  At the end of the game, a victor is

in this part of the round are completed  determined by the conditions in each now, such as Collateral Damage (see  scenario. If there is no clear winner, the Scenery for more details). game is a tie.

If there is any confusion on what order rules take place, follow the order of Initiative.

After resolving special rules, if the scenario states certain conditions under which the game ends, these should now be checked. If the conditions are met, or if the stated number of turns has elapsed then the game is over. If not, the round is over and another one begins immediately.

[Your Army](#_page39_x0.00_y595.28)[ Rules](#_page41_x0.00_y595.28)

Actions

Squads in Dropzone Commander may perform

**2 actions** during their activation. There are a few actions to choose from, but the most common are **moving** and **shooting**. Unless otherwise stated, **a squad cannot perform the same action twice in one activation.**

Not all units have to perform actions in a round, but at least 1 unit must perform an action during a Battlegroup s activation.

A squad may complete its actions in any order, but cannot split actions up (for example moving half distance, shooting, then moving the remaining distance).

**Units in a squad must perform the same actions simultaneously,** but different squads in a Battlegroup may perform different actions at different times.

Moving

Units within a squad may be moved **up to their maximum MV value.** A unit doesn t have to move its full MV, but any remaining distance is lost.

Simply pick a point within the unit s MV and move it there. Unless otherwise noted, units cannot move onto or over other units, however units in the same squad are ignored during movement (although still cannot end their move on another unit).

Units may turn on their axis as much as you want during their movement for no cost to their MV value, but doing so still counts as the unit having moved (this is particularly relevant for the purposes of shooting with some units). Some units have a MV value of 0 . These cannot move but may still turn on their axis.

Movement can be affected by many things (such as scenery), which will be detailed later on.

Shooting

To shoot at an enemy, the process is as simple as going through the weapon profile one statistic at a time.

Weapons

Most units are equipped with weapons capable of delivering death and destruction to the enemy. The offensive capabilities of a unit (if it has any) are represented by its weapons profile, an example of which is shown below.

**Move and Fire (M&F) -** The maximum distance the unit may move and

still fire the weapon. A dash here shows that the unit may move its full distance and still fire the weapon. If a unit shoots before moving, it cannot then move further than the M&F value.

**Arc of Fire (Arc) -** Describes the angles

at which the weapon can fire relative to the model s central axis.

16
[Building ](#_page39_x0.00_y595.28)[ Special ](#_page41_x0.00_y595.28)

**Full Range (R[F]) -** Represents the

maximum effective range of the weapon. Weapons with a range value represented by a ∞ symbol have essentially an infinite range within

the confines of the game table. Weapons with a range value of CQ are called Close Quarters weapons and require the attacking unit to be in the same Garrison as the target.

**Countered Range (R[C]) -** Represents

the effective range of the weapon against targets which employ Active countermeasures.

**Shots (S) -** The number of shots a weapon

has. Note that this purely simulates the extra killing power of rapid

fire weapons and does not always represent how many actual rounds are fired (a machine gun might fire dozens of bullets a second but won t get dozens of shots).

**Accuracy (Acc) -** Represents the

accuracy of the weapon. This is the dice roll value required when rolling to hit (lower target numbers are better). Weapons with a dash or a value of 0 automatically hit.

**Energy (E) -** Represents the destructive

power of the weapon.

**Special -** Any special rules which apply

to the weapon. Any special rules which are not outlined in the  Special Rules  section of the rulebook will be described below the unit s weapon profile.

Check Movement

If a unit moves over the weapon s Move & Fire value, it cannot be used during the same activation. Equally, if a weapon is used, a unit cannot then move further than its M&F value.

M&F is judged on a unit to unit basis, which means some units in a squad can move further than their M&F value and can t shoot while others that didn t move further than their M&F value may still shoot.

Check Weapon Arcs & Line of Sight

A target must be within a weapon s Arc value, as well as within line of sight. Units in a Garrison have line of sight to every other unit in that Garrison.

If a unit can see less than half of the target unit, they count as **Hull Down and that weapon suffers a +2 penalty to its Accuracy.** It s easiest to roll different coloured dice to represent shots that are and aren t Hull Down.

A weapon s arc of fire is represented by its Arc value. This will be expressed using the letters: F (front), S (side), and R (rear). For example, a weapon with an arc value of F/S may shoot at targets in front of and at the side of the model, whereas a weapon with an arc value of F/S/R has 360  arc of fire. Side arcs may be further dileneated by Left or Right facings.

Individual arcs are measured at 90 degree angles, with the front arc directly at the front of the miniature. Most miniatures will have easy arcs to measure, but some larger ones may be more complex. In these situations, you can align the arcs on the blast marker with the central axis of the shooting model.

The centre of an enemy model s main body or base must be within the weapon s arcs to be considered a legitimate target for that unit.

[Your Army](#_page39_x0.00_y595.28)[ Rules](#_page41_x0.00_y595.28)

Some units may have Active Countermeasures. These can detect and destroy or deflect incoming projectiles before they hit their target, either by using

a localized energy field, small directed energy beams, or physical munitions. Their effectiveness depends on the speed and point of origin of the incoming projectile, and as such they are less effective against high speed projectiles or shots from close range. They are also totally useless against directed energy weapons (such as lasers).

When targeting a unit with Active Countermeasures (shown in their stat sheet), a weapon must use its **R(C)**

**value**. If a unit **doesn t** have Active Countermeasures, it uses the **R(F) value**. A target must be within this range. If it is not, is cannot be shot. A target in physical contact with the shooting unit always counts as in range for all of its weapons.

Allocate Shots

Each unit in a squad may fire any or all of the weapons on its stat sheet, unless using Close Quarters weapons - see page 17 for details.

When allocating shots, a player **must declare targets for the entire squad before rolling any dice.** Pick an **enemy unit** to shoot at with each weapon for each unit. Separate weapons may fire at different units, (even other squads) but a weapon with multiple shots must use all of them against a single unit (see diagram opposite for an example).

It s easiest and quickest to combine shots together into a single roll, often using coloured dice to show which is which. When rolling dice, effects are resolved simultaneously for the entire shooting squad.

Roll a number of dice equal to the total number of Shots. The Accuracy value on the weapon is what those dice need to roll **equal to or over** in order to hit the target. Anything under the target number misses to no further effect. **Weapons with a dash automatically hit,** but weapons with an Accuracy of 0 roll as normal.

Modifiers (such as being Hull Down) are applied before rolling. **A weapon always hits on a roll of a 6, regardless of modifiers.**

A squad that is **out of coherency** suffers a **+1 penalty to its Accuracy.**

A squad that has **disembarked** during that activation suffers a **+2 penalty to its Accuracy** (see Transports for details).

Evasion Countermeasures

**Evasion Countermeasures** are employed before rolling to hit. A target s Evasion Countermeasures have a number next to them, which modifies the result needed.

For example a unit that is out of coherency shoots a weapon with 3+ Accuracy. The target has E+2 Countermeasures.

Being out of coherency adds a +1 penalty, making it a 4+ to hit. The target s Evasion Countermeasures confer an additional +2 penalty, so it requires a 6+ to hit.

[Rules ](#_page3_x0.00_y595.28)[Scenarios ](#_page31_x0.00_y595.28)Roll to Damage

The next stage is to determine if any damage is inflicted. **Roll 1 dice** for each successful hit and **add the weapon s Energy value**. If the result **equals or beats the target s Armour**, then 1 Damage is inflicted.

If the result beats the target s Armour by **2 or more,** the damage roll is a **Critical and inflicts 2 Damage**. **If the dice result is a 1, the weapon doesn t do any damage,** regardless of whether

it would otherwise equal or beat the Armour.

Note that low-energy weapons cannot damage well armoured targets (which make hardened targets like tanks immune to small arms fire). Also note that damage is never a foregone conclusion; an immensely powerful shot might simply graze a target or pass through non- essential systems, leaving it mostly intact.

Passive Countermeasures

Some units carry high tech energy shields, protecting them from all but the most deadly shots.

A target with **Passive Countermeasures** may now attempt to block the damage. The controlling player rolls 1 dice for each Damage, after modifiers like Criticals and the Devastator special rule (see Weapon Special Rules for more details).

[Your Army](#_page39_x0.00_y595.28)[ Rules](#_page41_x0.00_y595.28)

Passive Countermeasures have a number next to them. For every roll **equal to or higher** than that number, one Damage is discarded. **Passive Countermeasures may not be used against weapons with Energy 13 or higher.**

Resolve Damage

Every point of Damage inflicted is resolved against a single unit, causing them to lose 1 Damage Point each.

Any damage points inflicted on a unit should be recorded or indicated next to the model in some way (by using counters or small dice for example). This damage remains for the rest of the game.

If a unit drops to zero Damage Points then it is destroyed. If any special rules relate to its destruction (such as for Transports containing other units) then they should be acted on now. Otherwise the unit is removed from the table.

A unit cannot go below zero Damage Points. If there is more damage to resolve after a unit is destroyed, it is simply discarded.

Close Quarters Weapons & Fortitude

These weapons are denoted by a Range value of CQ, and make a few changes to the standard rules.

Close Quarters weapons require the attacking unit to be in the same Garrison as the target, **and are the only weapons that can be used against a unit in that situation.**

**If a squad chooses to shoot with Close Quarters weapons, it cannot use any other weapon profiles during that activation.**

Close Quarters weapons allocate shots to a **squad** instead of a **unit.**

**Close Quarters weapons automatically hit, but cannot inflict Criticals.**

Damage from a Close Quarters weapon is resolved against a squad, with the most damaged unit losing Damage Points first, or the controlling player deciding if there is a tie.

At the end of a Battlegroup s activation, if an Infantry squad **currently under 50%** of its original total Damage points has taken damage from a Close Quarters weapon during that activation it must make a **Fortitude Test.**

Roll 1 dice and consult their Fortitude.

If the result is equal to or higher than

the number, there is no effect. If the result is lower, the squad runs away! The squad must immediately abandon the Garrison or transfer to a linked Garrison. The squad may embark directly into a transport if possible. Squads that fail their Fortitude Test will drop any Objectives they re carrying (see Mobile Objectives for details). This move does not affect a squad s activation in any way.

**A squad that has to make a Fortitude Test can choose to fail it automatically.**

Transports

Transports are ubiquitous in Dropzone Commander, and have several rules tied to them to represent their carrying capacity.

Transport Values

All Transports and units which can be transported have a Transport value in their stat sheet. There are two types of value: **Requirement** and **Capacity.** Capacity denotes what kind of unit

can be transported by the Transport. Requirement denotes what a unit needs in order to be transported.

Requirement is shown by a solid symbol, and Capacity value is shown by an outlined symbol. **Any unit that has the outlined Capacity symbol is counted as a Transport,** and follows all the rules in this section.

There are several different types of symbols, representing differing carrying ability. The symbols are accompanied by a number, indicating the amount of space either required or available.

In order for a unit to be transported,

its Requirement symbol must **match**

a Transport s Capacity symbol and the Transport cannot carry more than the number listed in total. Some units will have different Capacity symbols. Some share the same number, and others have different Capacity for different types of passengers.

Some units will have both Capacity and Requirement symbols, showing that they are Transports that can in turn be carried by another, larger Transport.

3 6

The requirement symbol on the left

shows that the unit takes up 3 spaces in a transport. The capacity symbol on the right shows that the unit can transport up to six spaces of that symbol, so could transport up to 2 of the unit on the left.

Auxiliary Transports

Transports most often are part of the Auxiliary category, which are unlimited

in the number you can choose to field in an army. Rules for Auxiliary squads can

be found in the Army Roster section

(see page 51).

**Auxiliary Transports must begin the game with at least half Capacity filled.**

A Transport may have multiple squads embarked in it at once, but **may only have units from a single Battlegroup embarked at once.**

An Auxiliary Transport with units

embarked **must activate** with those units  Battlegroup. Any empty Auxiliary Transports can be activated with any Battlegroup, following the normal rules. However, any Auxiliary Transports cannot interact with units from a different Battlegroup to the one with which they are activated.

Any unit that can be embarked in a Transport may choose to be before the game starts, meaning that the Transport deploys with the rest of its embarked units  Battlegroup.

Although Transports usually operate independently, sometimes you may need

to use multiple Transports to carry a single squad, so they will have to act together out of necessity.

[Your Army](#_page39_x0.00_y595.28)[ Rules](#_page41_x0.00_y595.28)

Embarking & Disembarking

Squads may choose to either embark into or disembark from a transport **as part of a movement action.**

If a squad is **in coherency** and **at least one unit** **ends** its moving action within 2  of a transport in the same Battlegroup, it may embark into the transport(s), providing their transport values match. Remove the squad from the board - it is now embarked in the Transport(s).

A squad embarked in a Transport is **ignored** for all game purposes - they cannot shoot or be shot, don t count as moving when their Transport moves etc. Commanders in Transports still may use their Command Value, and Influence radius. Simply measure from the Transport they re embarked in.

A squad embarked in a Transport may choose to disembark when it makes a Moving action. Place them on the board within 2  of the Transport **in coherency,** and then make their moving action like normal. If any units cannot be placed (due to impassable scenery or other units being in the way for example), the squad cannot disembark.

An Infantry squad can disembark and immediately enter a Garrison if they disembark within 2  of an entrance (see Scenery for more details). This can be done even if it is not their activation (for example if an Aerial Transport disembarks them for free).

Sometimes squads cannot fit all of their units into a single Transport. If - and only if - this is the case, a squad can embark into multiple transports at the same time. **A squad cannot split its units between being embarked or disembarked** - all must be in or out of Transports at the

19

same time (remember to disembark in coherency). Alternatively, the squad can leave units stranded. Choose which units embark - the rest are destroyed.

The only time that a squad can be embarked and disembarked at the same time is if one of the Transports they re in is destroyed. In this situation, a squad may disembark out of coherency.

At other times, multiple squads may

be embarked in the same Transport. Individual squads must embark or disembark together, but multiple squads act independently, able to choose when or if they want to disembark. Remember though that all squads in a Transport must be from the same Battlegroup.

Aerial Transports

A Transport with the Aircraft type is called an Aerial Transport. Units cannot embark into or disembark from an Aerial Transport if it moves **further than half of its MV value** (rounding up) at any point during the round.

An Aerial Transport that moves **no further than half its MV value and lands**

in the same activation (see Aircraft for details), may immediately disembark any embarked units for free, **or** immediately embark any units in range (and still in the same Battlegroup) for free. This does not count as an action for those units, nor does it count as moving. However, disembarking or embarking units suffer the normal penalties to shooting. After the units embark or disembark, the Aerial Transport can choose to take off again, continuing its Moving action as normal.  It can also land again, but may only make this free embark or disembark once per activation.

Unless otherwise noted, units can only embark into or disembark from an Aerial Transport when it has landed.

In this example, we see a Condor that has moved half its MV of 18 . It lands and a Bear disembarks. It is placed within 2 . When the Bear activates it then drives 6  forward. On the Legionnaires  activation they disembark from the Bear and are placed within 2 . They then decide to make their full move of 2 .

Transports & Shooting

**Squads may not shoot in the same round as as embarking (either before or after).**

Squads may shoot in the same round **after** **disembarking,** but suffer a **+2 penalty to their Accuracy** for the action.

Anti-air weapons (AA) **cannot** shoot at an Aircraft (including Reaction Fire) in the same round as disembarking from an Aerial Transport or a Transport that disembarked from an Aerial Transport. The landing zone is too hot!

Shooting At Transports

If a Transport unit is destroyed while there are units embarked, the controlling player **rolls 1D3**. On a 3 there is no effect, but on a 1-2, each unit embarked suffers that many **Energy 10 automatic hits.** Passive Countermeasures may be used as normal against these hits.

After applying any damage, place the embarked unit on the board within 2  of the destroyed Transport before removing it. If any units cannot be placed (due to impassable scenery or other units being in the way for example), they are also destroyed.


[Building ](#_page39_x0.00_y595.28)[ Special ](#_page41_x0.00_y595.28)[Rules ](#_page3_x0.00_y595.28)[Scenarios ](#_page31_x0.00_y595.28)[Your Army](#_page39_x0.00_y595.28)[ Rules](#_page41_x0.00_y595.28)

Aircraft

In Dropzone Commander, most armies take to battle via aerial assault. Whether through transporting troops and vehicles or through lightning-fast attack runs, the battlefields are awash with rapidly deploying aircraft.

Aircraft play slightly differently to ground- based units, and this section details some of the changes to the base rules that they use.

Aircraft are mounted on flying stands. These bases are ignored for the purpose of the game, simply measuring from the model in the same way as any other unit. Note that other models can be placed on top of the flight stand base if necessary (if the aircraft finishes its move directly over them for example). All flight stands should be between 50mm and 70mm tall.

Moving

Aircraft can move over or onto units or scenery pieces up to 8  in height, even Impassable scenery. Any scenery over 8  is Impassable to them. Aircraft ignore any penalties from scenery such as Tough ground, and gain no benefits from scenery like Exceptional ground.

When moving Aircraft, simply measure horizontal distances, much the same

as any other unit. Aircraft may travel vertically (or diagonally) with no penalty to their movement.

For example an Aircraft on top of a 5  high building moves off of it. It doesn t have to move 5  down to the ground, simply using its MV value to travel horizontally instead.

Landing

An Aircraft can choose to land as part of its Moving action.

To land with an Aircraft, simply remove the model from its flight stand, and

place it on the board in the same space.

If an Aircraft cannot be placed (due to impassable scenery or other units being in the way for example), it cannot land.

Once an Aircraft has landed, it is treated as a Vehicle for all intents and purposes, losing any other bonuses that Aircraft usually have. Unless otherwise specified, landed Aircraft cannot move. Landed Aircraft cannot carry or claim Objectives.

A landed Aircraft can choose to take off as part of a Moving action - simply place the flight stand back on the model, and treat it as an Aircraft again with its full MV value.

An Aircraft can land and take off as many times as it likes during a Moving action.

Wobbly Aircraft

It is often tricky to balance Aircraft models on the table, since they can move anywhere and their height

can lead to a wobbly model. It is recommended to model scenery pieces with flat tops where possible to facilitate placing Aircraft models.

If an Aircraft can t be placed on a certain spot without fear of the model falling, use a token to represent the model, or simply take the Aircraft off its flying stand, and leave the stand there instead - no one wants their carefully painted miniatures to fall, but a clear flight stand can take a bit more of a beating!

In this situation, simply measure to the top of the flight stand as normal.

Shooting at Aircraft

Due to the elevation and speed of aircraft, **only specially designed Anti-Aircraft (AA) weapons may shoot at them when in the air** (see Weapon Special Rules for more details).

If an Aircraft is destroyed while in the air, it crashes to the ground! The **controlling player rolls 1D3**. On a 3 there is no effect, but on a 1-2, each scenery piece and unit (friendly and enemy) within that many inches (measured horizontally) gets hit

by the wreckage and suffer that many **Energy 10 automatic hits.**

Passive Countermeasures and Body Cover may be used as normal against these hits. **Other Aircraft are immune to these hits.**

If an Aerial Transport has embarked units, they are hit by this damage **instead** of

the damage outlined in the Shooting at Transports section. They then are placed on the board following the normal rules.

Small Aircraft

Some Aircraft are too small to cause much destruction. These are designated by the Aircraft-S type. When Small Aircraft are destroyed, they do not roll a dice, and are simply removed from the game.

Behemoths

Behemoths are among the largest land- based fighting vehicles in the 27th century. Towering over even super-heavy tanks, these colossi are capable of laying waste to entire formations single-handedly. They also feature exceedingly thick armour, making them nigh-on invulnerable to all but the most powerful weapons, usually those carried by other Behemoths.

To reflect their extreme size and power, Behemoths have a unique set of rules. These are fairly in depth and advanced, so we recommend new players get a few games in before scaling up their battles with the massive Behemoths.

**All Behemoths have the Large special rule.**

**Special rules and Command Cards have no effect on Behemoths unless explicitly mentioned.** Commanders in Behemoths may still use Command Cards as normal.

Behemoths have a number associated with them, known as their **Spread,** measured in inches from the centre of the Behemoth.

Behemoths may enter play as normal (following the normal Deployment rules to represent landing behind the lines

by Bulk Lander), or may choose to enter play via Drop-harness. Declare this when deploying the Behemoth s Battlegroup.

Drop-Harness

Drop-harnesses vary in design, but they all operate in a similar manner. Effectively, they are high-thrust, short burn decent arrestors, which slow a Behemoth s free-fall to allow for a safe landing. In this manner, they may be deployed from low-orbit by Strike Carriers. Drop-harnesses detach on landing and are either discarded or return to their point of origin under their own power. They cannot, however, lift a Behemoth back up from the surface.

This method of deployment is risky, especially in dense, urban areas populated by enemies. Infantry units deployed alongside a Behemoth often take to battle with portable scanners able to fully 3D map a limited

area. Once these scans are made, damage upon landing is mitigated. Without them,

it s not unknown for a Behemoth to sustain critical damage during descent, making

for little more than an extremely costly bombardment.

When a Behemoth enters play via Drop- harness, it must be called down with a special Signal action. This can only be done when a Behemoth is In Readiness.

A Signal action counts as two actions for an activation, and may only be done **by Infantry squads.** Pick a point on the board **within 6  of the Infantry unit**

(or edge of occupied Garrison).

If there are no Infantry units squads left to call down a Behemoth, it misses the battle!

Place the Behemoth on that point. A Behemoth **can** be placed on top of scenery pieces and friendly and enemy units. **Every Destructible scenery piece or squad within its Spread is landed**

**on and takes 2D3 automatic Energy**

**12 hits** (roll once for all affected units). Damage can be dealt to any units in the

27
[Building ](#_page39_x0.00_y595.28)[ Special ](#_page41_x0.00_y595.28)[Rules ](#_page3_x0.00_y595.28)[Scenarios ](#_page31_x0.00_y595.28)[Your Army](#_page39_x0.00_y595.28)[ Rules](#_page41_x0.00_y595.28)

squad (not just those within the Spread), allocated by the Behemoth s controlling player. Body Cover may be used as normal. **Resolve all damage before proceeding with the Behemoth s landing.**

Arriving via Drop-harness is a risky manoeuvre, and may cause damage to the Behemoth on landing. When a Behemoth arrives via Drop-harness, after rolling for damage to squads and Scenery pieces, check to see which conditions on the table below are met and **roll the total number of dice listed.** Each condition can be met multiple times.** For every **1-2 rolled,** the Behemoth loses **1 Damage Point from**

**a random Zone.** Note that any Scenery pieces or squads that were destroyed by the Behemoth landing are removed before consulting the table.



|Condition|<p>Number of </p><p>Dice per Instance</p>|
| - | - |
|Landed on Impassable Scenery|5|
|<p>Landed on Tough </p><p>scenery</p>|2|
|Landed within 3” of an enemy squad|2|
|Landed on a unit|1|
|<p>Landed within R(C) and line of sight of </p><p>an AA weapon.</p>|1|
If there are any Impassable Scenery pieces left on the board within the Behemoth s Spread after resolving these hits, the controlling player moves the Behemoth

a minimum distance until it is clear. The controlling player then moves any units within its Spread a minimum distance so that the Behemoth can be placed.

**Behemoths that enter via Drop- harness cannot be activated that round.**

For example, a Behemoth lands via Drop- harness on top of 2 Impassable scenery pieces, 4 units, and within 3  of 3 enemy squads. Upon landing the Behemoth destroys one of the Impassable scenery pieces, and 2 of the units it lands on. After this is resolved, the Behemoth must roll a total of 10 dice (5 for the Impassable scenery piece, 2 for the units underneath it, and 3 for the enemy squads within 3 ). From those rolls it takes 3 points

of damage which are randomly allocated to different Zones. The controlling player then moves the Behemoth a minimum distance away from the Impassable scenery piece. Any units under it are then moved, and finally it is placed, ready to begin the game.

Behemoths & Moving

These war engines are so large that an entire battle may be going on underneath them, but caution should be taken by anyone foolish enough to wander under a Behemoth s feet!

When moving, units may go directly underneath a Behemoth - should their miniature fit. When judging this, simply use the Behemoth s legs (or leg facsimiles) as where the model sits. Aircraft fly under (or over) in the normal manner.

Behemoths suffer no penalty to their MV value when moving over Tough terrain, and may move over Impassable scenery and units up to half the height of the model.

Behemoths may move through Impassable scenery pieces **over** half the height of

the model, provided they can physically be placed where they end their Moving action. **Any Destructible scenery pieces moved through in this way suffer**

**D3 Energy 10 automatic hits.** Any of these hits that fail to damage are instead resolved as successful damage rolls against a random zone on the Behemoth. Passive Countermeasures can be used against these as normal.

[Your Army](#_page39_x0.00_y595.28)[ Rules](#_page41_x0.00_y595.28)

29

When moving a Behemoth, pick a point to move it to within its MV value as normal. Measure its Spread from that point. **Every Destructible scenery piece or squad (friendly and enemy) within its Spread takes D3 automatic Energy 10 hits** (roll once for all affected units). Damage can be dealt to any unit in the squad (not just those within the Spread), allocated by the Behemoth s controlling player. **Aircraft cannot be damaged in this way.** Body Cover may be used as normal. Resolve

all damage before proceeding with the Behemoth s movement.

After resolving this damage, if necessary the controlling player moves their surviving units a minimum distance

so that the Behemoth can be placed. A Behemoth can be deliberately used in this way to stomp on its opponents!

Behemoths & Shooting

When targeting a Behemoth, measure to any point within its Spread.

Due to their massive energy banks, **Behemoths may use Passive Countermeasures against all hits, regardless of their Energy value.**

**Weapons with the Area special rule** do not place the blast template when targeting a Behemoth. Instead they fire as a normal weapon of that type. Area weapons targeting other units have no effect on Behemoths.

Zones

Behemoths are so large that distinct areas may be targeted and damaged or destroyed.

A Behemoth is split into three zones: Hull, Legs, and Weapons. The main profile of a Behemoth has no Damage value. Instead, each zone has its own Damage points,

and may be targeted separately. Keep track of damage on these zones as if they were individual units. Whenever a unit shoots a Behemoth, choose a zone to target.

A zone loses damage points as any

other unit, but each zone has a number

of Damage Thresholds. Once a zone

goes below a Damage Threshold, it is Crippled. Each unit profile will specify what the Damage Thresholds are and the relevant Crippled effects - simply follow the instructions listed whenever it is Crippled. When there are multiple options in a Crippled result (such as a choice of weapons being destroyed) the **targeting player chooses** which result applies. A single weapon can only target one zone, but can Cripple that zone multiple times with one volley if it is lucky (or particularly powerful).

Note that these Damage Thresholds don t necessarily match exactly on a one-to-one basis - a Behemoth may have only two legs on the miniature, but have four Damage Thresholds on its Legs, representing the total amount of damage the two legs can take.

Every time a Behemoth is Crippled, after resolving the effects, the targeting player chooses 1 other Zone. That Zone loses

1 Damage Point. This can cause further Crippled results, making a chain reaction!

Weapons with the **Structural** special rule cannot be affected by Crippled results unless specifically mentioned.

A zone may go below a Damage Threshold and then subsequently go back above that Threshold (healing Damage Points for example). In this situation the Crippled result remains, and the Damage Threshold is ignored **- each Threshold can only cause one Crippled result.** Once a zone is completely destroyed, it cannot replenish damage points.

Destroying Behemoths

A Behemoth may have parts blown off it, but will still be active in the game - albeit at severely reduced efficiency! The only way to truly destroy a Behemoth is to cause irreparable structural harm.

When a Behemoth is reduced to **0 Damage Points on 2 zones,** it is destroyed. **Roll 1 dice.**

**On a 2+,** the Behemoth explodes in spectacular fashion and **all scenery pieces and units** (friendly and enemy) within that many inches (measured horizontally) get hit by the explosion and

suffer that many **Energy 10 automatic hits.** Passive Countermeasures and Body Cover may be used as normal against these hits. Leave the Behemoth on the board as Impassable scenery - it still blocks line of sight and movement, but cannot otherwise be interacted with, since it is destroyed.

**On a roll of a 1** the primary core collapses and despite all fail-safes, a localised singularity event occurs. Roll again. **All scenery pieces and units** within that many inches are **removed from the board,** including the Behemoth itself (and yes, that includes any other Behemoths in range!).

Scenery

Battlefields of the future are hardly ever featureless wastelands, and normally include various kinds of scenery which can strongly affect the game. Dropzone Commander is best played on a table

with plenty of scenery, which almost always makes a game more interesting, tactical and varied. There are hundreds of different types of scenery in a game, all of which follow certain rules. Simply agree with your opponent at the start of the game what rules each scenery piece uses.

Passable

A broadly horizontal space such as streets, fields, or snow to name a few. Small contours also fall into this category. Passable scenery has no special rules associated with it. Most of a board is passable scenery.

Impassable

Solid walls, massive piles of rubble, or lakes. Steep contours also fall into this category. Impassable scenery cannot be moved through unless specified.

Exceptional

Uninterrupted ground, made for fast travel such as roads and highways. Vehicles without the Skimmer special rule spending their entire move action on Exceptional scenery gain +2  to their MV value.

Tough

Tough scenery could be particularly rocky ground, fences, or dense foliage. Any move through Tough scenery costs 2  of MV for every 1  of it crossed.

Solid

Cliffs, buildings, or particularly advanced

force fields. This scenery cannot have 27line of sight drawn through it, whether

a physical line of sight can be drawn or not. For example, a building with open windows can technically have line of sight drawn through it, but it is classed as Solid, so cannot.

Soft Cover

Tall fields, chain link fences, or even more esoteric sources like artificial light dampeners. Infantry targets in or within

1  of Soft Cover impart a +2 penalty to Accuracy rolls on weapons firing at them, providing the Soft Cover is between them and the shooter.

Body Cover

Barricades, walls, or small piles of rubble. Infantry targets in or within 1  of Body Cover impart a +1 penalty to damage rolls on weapons firing at them, providing

the Body Cover is between them and

the shooter. Body Cover cannot be used against CQ weapons.

Destructible

Buildings, forests, or barricades. Scenery pieces with this rule have Armour and Damage Points and can be destroyed. Although most scenery could fall into this category, it s simpler to let mostly Garrisons be Destructible.

The Armour and Damage Points of a Destructible scenery piece can vary a

lot, but for ease of play, several types are included in the Features section on page 40. When shooting at a Destructible scenery piece, weapons **hit on a 2+ before Accuracy modifiers** (for example disembarking and then shooting would hit on a 4+). Scenery cannot be Hull Down.

**If a weapon scores a Critical on a Destructible scenery piece, it only loses 1 Damage Point.** However, it also receives a **Collateral Damage token.** It s easiest to use a dice to keep track of

Collateral Damage toekns. See Collateral Damage on page 39 for rules on resolving Collateral Damage.

**When a Destructible piece of scenery with 10 or more starting Damage Points is destroyed, roll 1D3.** Any units within that many inches (measured from the edges of the scenery piece) take that many automatic hits with an **Energy value equal to the scenery piece s Armour.** Body Cover may not be used against these hits.

**Each unit inside a Garrison that is destroyed instead takes 2D3 hits.** Roll once and apply the result to each unit inside. **If an Objective that isn t being carried (see Objectives for details) is in a Garrison that is destroyed, the Objective is removed from the game.**

After resolving the damage, remove the scenery piece from the game and replace it with a flat piece of Tough scenery no bigger than the original size. Any piece with 9 or less starting Damage Points is simply removed.

Garrison

Bunkers, skyscrapers, or forests.

These scenery pieces can be garrisoned by any Infantry unit. More detailed rules for garrisons can be found on the following pages.

Flammable

Forests, grass fields, or gas plants.

**This scenery piece resolves its Collateral Damage at Energy 2.**

Additionally, if this scenery piece or a unit inside this scenery piece is targeted by a **weapon with the Flame special rule,**

the scenery piece receives an additional Collateral Damage token.

Garrisons

Interactions with Garrisons have several specific rules, and a few changes to other rules for open conflict.

Entering & Exiting

Any scenery piece with the Garrison rule may be occupied by Infantry units. A Garrison cannot hold more units at any one time than it has starting Damage Points.

If an Infantry squad is **in coherency** and

**at least one unit** ends its moving action within 2  of an entrance, the whole squad can enter the garrison. An entrance refers to anywhere the unit could feasibly enter the garrison, such as doors or windows in the case of buildings, or simply the edge of the scenery piece for forests and other open garrisons. Infantry can disembark from

a Transport straight into a Garrison (see Transports for more details).

Once infantry are inside, remove them from the table and indicate their presence inside in some way. The easiest way to do this is to place them in the middle of the Garrison. Indeed, it s often a good idea to design Garrison scenery pieces with a flat roof or clearing in the centre for this purpose.

When entering a Garrison, an Infantry squad may choose to occupy the centre, or any edge.

A squad may choose to leave a Garrison as part of their Moving action. Place them on the board within 2  of the Garrison **in coherency and discard any remaining MV distance.**  Alternatively an Infantry squad may be forced to abandon the Garrison, in which case they are placed in exactly the same way.

A squad that leaves a Garrison (through moving out or abandoning it) can embark directly into a Transport, following the normal rules.

[Your Army](#_page39_x0.00_y595.28)[ Rules](#_page41_x0.00_y595.28)


[Rules ](#_page3_x0.00_y595.28)[Scenarios ](#_page31_x0.00_y595.28)[Building ](#_page39_x0.00_y595.28)[ Special ](#_page41_x0.00_y595.28)

If a Garrison has **more enemy squads occupying it than friendly squads,**

any squad wanting to leave the Garrison must first make a Fortitude Test. If it **passes it leaves as normal,** but if it

**fails it first loses Damage Points**

**equal to the amount it failed by,** before running away as per the Fortitude rules (dropping any Objectives they re carrying as normal). This damage is allocated by the opposing player with the most squads in the Garrison.

Moving in a Garrison

Infantry inside a Garrison may choose to move through it. While a Garrison may have multiple storeys, it s assumed that the Infantry squads cover all of the storeys in their time inside, so these levels have no bearing on gameplay.

**All units are always counted as being within 1  of every other unit** (friendly and enemy) in the same Garrison. This means that all Infantry squads count as being **in coherency.**

To move in a Garrison, simply choose an edge of the Garrison for your Infantry units to move to, regardless of its distance away. **Units in the same squad can move to different edges,** or not move at all, but **no units can move to the same edge as an enemy unit.** While this movement counts as an action, **the units count as remaining stationary for**

**the purposes of their weapons  M&F distance.**

The easiest way of representing infantry movement inside a Garrison is to move the units to the edge they re occupying. While most scenery pieces have easy-to- identify edges, some will be a bit more complicated. In this situation, simply agree with your opponent at the start of the game.

Shooting in a Garrison

Any Infantry units in a Garrison may shoot at enemy Infantry units in the same Garrison. This type of shooting may **only be done with Close Quarters weapons,** which is covered in the Shooting section. Units may target any enemies no matter whether they are on the edge of a Garrison or not. A unit on the edge of a Garrison **cannot** shoot Close Quarters weapons and other weapons in the same activation (although only Close Quarters weapons can target units in the Garrison).

If an Infantry squad enters a Garrison that is occupied by one or more enemy squads and **then makes a Shooting action against them in the same activation,** they must **re-roll any successful damage rolls** as the occupying force

has the advantage and is able to defend against the attack.

Any Infantry units that are on an edge of a Garrison may choose to shoot out of the Garrison, provided it has adequate space to do so (such as windows on a building). Line of sight, weapon arcs and range are all measured from any point along the edge that the unit is occupying, counting as a Front arc.

Shooting at a Garrison

Most Garrisons will have the Solid rule, which means any **units inside cannot**

be targeted. However, **if a unit has moved to the edge of a Garrison,** they may be targeted as normal. Line of sight, weapon arcs and range are all measured to any point along the edge that the unit is occupying. Garrison edges count towards both Body Cover and Soft Cover if the scenery piece has those rules listed.

[Rules ](#_page3_x0.00_y595.28)[Scenarios ](#_page31_x0.00_y595.28)Linked Garrisons

Sometimes, Garrisons are linked by a walkways or similar structure. Garrisons no more than 2  apart may count as linked. Agree with your opponent at

the start of the game which Garrisons

are linked. Squads can move from one Garrison to another linked Garrison as

a Moving action. In this case, the entire squad must move to the new Garrison. Treat this move as entering a new Garrison (including for choosing edges to move to or shooting penalties).

Linked Garrisons are a great way of making massive structures. Simply agree with your opponent which parts of a Garrison count as separate linked areas. This allows troops to occupy specific areas of a big Garrison, and allows for certain parts to be destroyed piecemeal!

Often a large structure that counts as a Linked Garrison won t come in multiple parts, which means that each linked Garrison won t be able to be removed when destroyed. In this situation it s best to just use your imagination! The scenery piece still follows the same rules, even if it cannot be physically taken apart.

Collateral Damage

Burning foliage and falling masonry are just as dangerous to occupying forces as a direct hit from a tank shell. Once a structure starts falling apart, whole floors can give way, and fires in forests spread quicker than troops can escape.

Collateral Damage tokens are always resolved at the start of the Round Up Phase. In addition, if the scenery piece affected is an **occupied Garrison,** the tokens are resolved **immediately** after that Shooting action has been completed.

This includes a Garrison suffering a Critical hit, and Collateral Damage tokens from other places (such as Flame weapons). When a Garrison resolves Collateral Damage in this way, all tokens are resolved simultaneously, regardless of whether they were just placed or already on the Garrison.

Each Collateral Damage token causes **one automatic hit at Energy 4**

**against the scenery piece.** If it s an occupied Garrison, each token also does one automatic hit at Energy 4 to one randomised squad inside. Roll once to randomise and resolve all tokens against that squad.

Body Cover is ignored for Collateral Damage, but Passive Countermeasures can be used as usual. The opposing player allocates damage to a unit in the squad. **Collateral Damage cannot cause Criticals, but automatically damages on a roll of 6.**

If a Collateral Damage hit rolls high enough to damage the scenery piece, it takes 1 damage as normal, and the token is left on to be rolled again at the start of the next round up phase. If the hit doesn t roll high enough to damage the scenery piece (regardless of whether it damages any infantry inside), remove the token.

For example, a Garrison occupied by 2 squads has 4 Collateral Damage tokens. 1 dice is rolled - on a 1-3 they hit Squad A, and 4-6 Squad B. A 3 is rolled, and Squad A and the Garrison suffer 4 Energy 4 hits.

Squad A take 3 damage from their hits, and the Garrison takes 2 damage. 2 Collateral Damage tokens are removed, and 2 are left on.

Scenarios

All warfare is meaningless without a purpose, be it noble or nefarious. Whilst every great campaign has overall goals, specific actions on the ground will

have smaller but no less significant

aims. Sometimes, the apparently small accomplishments of a few troops in the right place at the right time can tip the outcome of an entire campaign.

The scenarios detailed in this part of the book lend purpose to your games, and are designed to represent the type of actions that are typically suited to highly mobile forces.

These scenarios will give you some inspiration, focus and consistency, but feel free to modify them or to invent your own. You could also string multiple scenarios together to cover a wider battle, or even an over-arching campaign.

The scenarios in this book have been designed to be fair, balanced, and to treat all players equally. But that doesn t mean that all are equally easy to play for all players! Some factions or army builds will favour certain styles of play. If you feel you had a hard time completing a scenario, make sure to discuss how to improve, and next time even try swapping sides to see how you do. Feel free to edit scenarios or create new ones as you see fit - you may find a new and interesting way to play!

Simply choose and follow the rules of one of the scenarios listed either in this book or in another supplement.

Scenarios have several different elements to them, instructing the players how

to play and win. In this section we ll go through these elements, guiding you in a game from start to finish.

Special Rules

Some scenarios will have some extra rules. Simply follow these for the game. Others will have optional suggestions, such as more specific scenery uses or simple ways to change the scenarios. Follow these at your leisure!

Army

After choosing a scenario, you ll find out how many players can play, and what points level the scenario plays at. Usually the points limits are simply guidelines, but some scenarios have asymmetrical points, with attackers and defenders choosing armies differently. Either decide among the players who will play which role, or roll a dice to determine.

Setup

Each scenario is accompanied by a map showing how to set up the gaming board and how each army deploys. Some scenarios will have several mandatory scenery elements, but each scenario

will have plenty of space for your own interpretation. When setting up scenery, some scenarios will specify that one player sets it up. If not specified, it s good to place scenery pieces alternately until the board is full.

Games of Dropzone Commander should take place in scenery-rich environments. Dropzones are often key points on planets, be they valuable cities, important tactical chokeholds, or military strongholds to name a few. Not only this, but games are more fun with more scenery! Different gaming boards breathe fresh air into a game, forcing players to reassess their tactics in every encounter.

A simple guideline to follow would be that **half** of your Dropzone Commander gaming boards should have some kind

of scenery element on, whether that s buildings, forests, roads, or even just hills. Scenery elements don t have to be placed equidistant from each other - some of

the most fun battles are fought in tightly packed streets, with infantry running between linked buildings to get back to their transport who is hiding out of range of enemy fire!

Dropzone Commander is broadly designed to be played on a **4 foot by 4 foot board,** although smaller boards work fine for smaller games, and larger boards are needed for the biggest battles.

Deployment

Deployment zones are different for each scenario, and although distances are specified, it may be worth changing the zones if you change the size of board you re playing on.

After setting up scenery, each player rolls a dice, re-rolling any ties. The player with the highest score picks a deployment zone, followed by the next highest and so on.

The scenario will specify if and how many Battlegroups are Directly Deployed, In Readiness, or In Reserve.

After picking a deployment zone, the player with the highest roll chooses a Battlegroup to deploy, followed by the next highest player and so on, cycling through players until all Battlegroups have been deployed. **Any unit that can be embarked in a Transport may choose to be before the game starts, meaning that the Transport deploys with the rest of the Battlegroup.**

Other Auxiliary squads can be deployed as part of a Battlegroup, or deployed all together after all other Battlegroups.

When deploying a Battlegroup, all units in that Battlegroup must be deployed in the same way. A Battlegroup cannot split its squads between In Readiness and In Reserve for example. Declare for each Battlegroup (according to the scenario rules) when you pick them to deploy.

Directly Deployed

Battlegroups that are Directly Deployed are placed anywhere in their own deployment zone, not on scenery pieces they cannot move across, with all units in coherency within their squads.

In Readiness

Battlegroups that are deployed In Readiness are waiting just outside of

the table. Inform your opponents that the Battlegroup is In Readiness. These Battlegroups can be activated during a round like any other Battlegroup. In that activation, all units must make a Moving action measured from any board edge inside their deployment zone. You can choose to not activate an In Readiness Battlegroup, in which case it will remain In Readiness until the next round.

In Reserve

Battlegroups that are deployed In Reserve are slow to arrive to the battlefield. Inform your opponents that the Battlegroup is

In Reserve. Battlegroups In Reserve may not complete actions until the scenario specifies they can move out of being In Reserve.

If not specified in the scenario, units in Reserve automatically move to In Readiness at the end of the first round.

Aerial Advantage

Aircraft are able to react to dropzones much quicker than conventional ground-based war machines, and commanders are often the first to battle to oversee their forces.

Any Battlegroup that is **not** an HQ Battlegroup or a Battlegroup deployed entirely in Aircraft (including Auxiliary Transports) always starts the game In Reserve, regardless of the scenario rules.

Duration

How many rounds the game lasts for.

Victory Conditions

Games use two methods of determining victory: **Victory Points** and **Kill Points.**

Victory Points are the most important, and are most often earned by capturing Objectives. Victory Points are usually calculated at the end of the game - the player with the most wins.

Kill Points are used to determine who wins in the event of a tie in Victory Points and often generate extra Victory Points of their own. Kill Points are simply the total points value of all destroyed enemy units and Commanders. Damaged units do not count towards Kill Points; they must be destroyed outright to count.

Objectives

An Objective is a catch-all name for something that your army will generally need to discover, capture, or extract from

the combat zone in order to win the game. Objectives could be valuable pieces of intel, technology, or strategic points - all operate in the same way.

**Objectives are best represented by small, double-sided tokens, 30mm in diameter.** Measure to the centre of the token as normal.

Objectives are set up on the board after scenery is setup but before deployment. Unless otherwise stated, players take turns to place Objectives. Objectives can be found in many places, including forests, buildings, road intersections, and even wrecked vehicles. When placing Objectives they may be placed anywhere on the battlefield at least 6  away from any board edge or from each other. They may be placed inside Garrisons - simply put the token on top of the Garrison. **If an Objective that isn t being carried**

**is in a Garrison that is destroyed, the Objective is removed from the game.** Objectives inside Garrisons may only be interacted with by a unit inside that same Garrison.

Objectives have several special rules that can be used in any combination in a scenario.

Open Objectives

These Objectives are easy to see and obtain. If a friendly Infantry or Vehicle unit **in coherency** is **within 2  of the Objective**

**or in the same Garrison as it, they claim the Objective.** Objectives can be reclaimed by other players if they meet those criteria and there are no enemy units that also

meet that criteria.

Unless otherwise noted, all Objectives not in Garrisons are Open Objectives.

Hidden Objectives

These Objectives are harder to find, even if a commander knows their general location. A Hidden Objective must be discovered. Unless otherwise noted,

all Objectives in Garrisons are Hidden Objectives.

A friendly Infantry or Vehicle squad **in coherency** with at least 1 unit **within**

**2**  of a Hidden Objective or in the same Garrison as a Hidden Objective may make a special **search action,** counting as **both** of their actions for the round. A Hidden Objective in a Garrison may only be searched for by squads in the same Garrison.

When searching, **roll 1 dice for the squad** searching. If there are **enemy units within 2  or in the same Garrison,** the dice roll is modified by **-1.** Add the resulting number to the number of the current round. **If the result is**

**7 or more,** the Objective permanently becomes an Open Objective and the unit claims it.

A Transport that doesn t have the Aircraft type may choose to make a scan action, counting as both of its actions for the round. Place a **Scan Token** by the unit. Before a squad makes a search roll, you may **remove any friendly Scan Tokens within 2  to add +1 to the search roll per token.** If the searching unit is in a Garrison, measure the distance to any edge of the Garrison. If the Transport makes a Moving action, remove its Scan Token. **A unit may only have 1 Scan Token at a time.**

Mobile Objectives

Mobile Objectives can be picked up and moved. This will stop an enemy getting the Objective, and some scenarios will even call for Objectives to be extracted

35from the board.

If a Mobile Objective has been **claimed** by an Infantry or Vehicle unit, their squad automatically counts as carrying it. The Objective is moved with the squad. Only Infantry or Vehicle squads may carry Objectives, but they may in turn embark into non-Vehicle units such as Aircraft.

**A squad may only carry one Objective at any time.**

Mobile Objectives can be passed to another friendly Infantry or Vehicle squad (even from another squad or Battlegroup) if any units are within 2  of each other

at any point during either of their activations. If a squad is in a Garrison, they **cannot pass** an Objective to a squad outside of that same Garrison. Equally a squad outside a Garrison **cannot pass** an Objective to a squad inside a Garrison.

A squad can drop an Objective at any time - simply place it within 2  of any unit. If the squad is in a Garrison, the Objective cannot be dropped outside of the Garrison. If the squad is outside of

a Garrison it cannot be dropped inside the Garrison. A dropped Objective automatically becomes unclaimed. If a squad is **out of coherency** at the **end** of its activation, or **fails a Fortitude Test,** it **automatically drops any Objective** it was carrying. If an enemy squad is within 1  of this squad or in the same Garrison, they automatically claim it. If more than one opponent has a squad within 1 , the Objective remains unclaimed.

If a squad carrying an Objective is **destroyed,** they drop the Objective before being removed them from

the game. **If destroyed by a Close Quarters weapon, that unit claims the Objective automatically instead.** If a squad carrying an Objective is destroyed whilst in an Aircraft, the Objective is destroyed too.

[Your Army](#_page39_x0.00_y595.28)[ Rules](#_page41_x0.00_y595.28)

Targets of Opportunity

Some key objectives have been detected inside a small landing area at the heart of the warzone. Your aim is to enter these zones, find and seize the objectives, and extract them before the enemy has a chance to do the same!

Army

`   `2-4 players. Setup

`   `4 x4  board. Deployment

`   `Opposite board edges. 2 players

`  `shown in blue, 3-4 players shown in    yellow.

`   `All units begin In Readiness.

Duration

`   `6 rounds.

Victory Conditions

3 Hidden Mobile Objectives placed along the centre line of the board (shown in green as examples). When playing with 3-4 players or in a Battle add 4 more Hidden Mobile Objectives (shown in orange as examples).

Each Objective scores 1 Victory Point to the player holding it at the end of the game.

If a squad carrying an Objective ends its activation with at least 1 unit within 1  of their friendly board edge, remove them from the game and place them In Readiness. The Objective is removed and instead scores 2 Victory Points for that player at the end of the game.

This scenario works best with plenty of scenery.

It s recommended that every Objective be placed within a Garrison, although it can be played in a more open environment with a few forests or sparse bunkers to protect the Objectives.

Variant:  Primary Target

In this scenario, the centre objective is worth twice as many Victory Points, and should be placed in a large Garrison - the bigger the better!

Battle Royale

Armies are about to clash and your orders are refreshingly simple - annihilate the enemy! Rapidly occupying the best ground will be instrumental in securing victory. Lock and load!

Army

`   `2-4 players. Setup

`   `4 x4  board.

`   `1 large Garrison in the centre

`  `of the board (shown in green as     example).

`   `2 large Garrisons at least 12  from    board edges (shown in purple as     examples).

`   `When playing with 3-4 players    or in a Battle, add 2 extra large    Garrisons (shown in orange as    examples).

Deployment

Opposite board edges. 2 players shown in blue, 3-4 players shown in yellow. All units begin In Readiness.

Duration

6 rounds.

Victory Conditions

The player with the most Kill Points at the end of the game wins. Special Rules

` `**Vantage Point:** Infantry units firing out of the large Garrisons double their R(F) and R(C) values.

Variant:  Military Complex

The secondary Garrisons are linked with the centre Garrison, and more are added, making a sprawling complex for Infantry to fight through. Entire sections of the complex can be destroyed from the outside, meaning Infantry will need constant support to move through and purge the enemy.

Bunker Assault

The enemy is taking hold of key planetary defences, and it is your mission to take and hold a bunker complex linked to an orbital laser. This is a high value target to capture - be prepared for enemy contact!

Army

`   `2-4 players.

Setup

`   `4 x4  board.

`   `3 Garrisons , one in the centre

`  `of the board and two others in

`  `opposite quarters (shown in green    as examples).

`   `When playing with 3-4 players

`  `or in a Battle, add 2 extra  Garrisons    (shown in orange as examples).

Deployment

Within 12  of opposite board corners. 2 players shown in blue, 3-4 players shown in yellow.

All units begin either Directly Deployed or In Readiness.

Duration

6 rounds.

Victory Conditions

Each listed Garrison contains one Open Objective worth 1 Victory Point.

For each listed Garrison, the player with the highest number of points of units within 6  scores 2 Victory Points. Infantry units inside the Garrison are worth double their points. If the Garrisons are destroyed, this condition is instead worth only 1 Victory Point (replace the Garrison with Tough scenery as normal).

The Garrisons in this scenario should be Medium or Large Bunkers, as listed in the Features section.

Variant:  Hive Assault

Garrisons lose the Destructible rule, meaning they will always last until the end of the game. This makes for a more fierce fight.

Survey and Control

Careful intelligence gathering and sector by sector control is necessary in this area

- sweeping ground and finding out what the enemy has planned is top priority for headquarters.

Army

`   `2 players. Setup

`   `4 x4  board.

`   `5-10 Garrisons in a Skirmish.    10-15 Garrisons in a Clash.

`   `15-20 Garrisons in a Battle. Deployment

`   `Opposite board edges (in blue).    All units begin In Readiness.

Duration

`   `6 rounds.

Victory Conditions

Each Garrison contains 1 Open Objective. When a unit claims each Objective, roll on the table below.



|Dice Roll|Effect|
| - | - |
|1|<p>Booby Trap: Score 1 Victory Point. The Garrison suffers D6 automatic </p><p>Energy 9 hits.</p>|

Variant:  Stop the Clock

This version best represents a vicious commander that has rigged a city with explosives (such as Salakahn), with opposing forces looking to find a way to avert (or encourage) the destruction. The setup is the same, but the Objective table is changed to be more dangerous!

Building Your Army

The battlefields of the 27th Century are dangerous places, with armies fighting for supremacy over entire worlds and solar systems, trying to take control of the galaxy for resources and survival.

51

Armies in Dropzone Commander are built following a structure. This represents the typical sorts of compositions of forces in a battlezone, from the largest Behemoths all the way down to the humble infantry soldier.

Players can build armies in thousands

of different ways, but unless otherwise agreed with your opponents, your army should follow the guidelines laid out here.

The Army Roster

This is a framework which defines the overall composition of armies. It shows how many Battlegroups of each type are required and permitted in an army for a given game size.

The size of a game is agreed with your opponent beforehand. Dropzone Commander is best played at up to 3000 points. Larger game sizes are certainly

possible, but will need multiple army rosters to be fully balanced. A standard game of Dropzone Commander is a 1750 point Clash.

Numbers in the table represent the number of Battlegroups of a given type that are permitted. Fixed values indicate compulsory numbers of certain types, while a range of some types may be allowed.

Unless otherwise stated, a single Battlegroup may not come to **more than 33%** of your army s total allowed points cost for **Clashes and Battles, and 50% for Skirmishes.** This does **not include** the points cost of any mounted Commanders, who are bought outside of the Army Roster structure. **A Battlegroup containing a Behemoth cannot have any other units and can exceed the points percentage limit in an army.**

Auxiliary Squads

**Squads that have the Auxiliary category are picked outside of the Battlegroup structure, and a player**

**is allowed to use as many Auxiliary squads as they like.** Auxiliary squads are often Transports, chosen to ferry units to and from the battlefield, but could also be more esoteric units.

**Auxiliary Transports must begin the game with at least half Capacity filled.**

Unlike normal squads, Auxiliary squads do not belong to a particular Battlegroup. Instead, **each time a player activates a Battlegroup,** they may choose to activate **as many Auxiliary squads as they**

**wish** as part of that Battlegroup, acting as any other unit in that Battlegroup. Simply declare which Auxiliary squads are being activated at the start of the Battlegroup s activation. **Auxiliary squads may still only be activated once per round.**

If there are Auxiliary squads left over which are yet to complete their actions after every available Battlegroup has been activated, then these remain inactivated that turn (so don t forget to activate them with a Battlegroup at some point).

Making Battlegroups

A typical Battlegroup will contain between 1 and 6 squads. Battlegroups normally consist of complementary squads which together can fulfil a specific battlefield role.

For example, an Armour Battlegroup will contain large numbers of tanks, while a Vanguard Battlegroup will contain more specialized squads.

Each unit has a **Category,** represented by a symbol on their stat sheet. This Category is used to determine which units are allowed in which Battlegroups. Their compositions are defined by the Battlegroup Sheets, which are shown below.

Numbers in the sheets represent the number of Squads of a given category that are allowed in a single Battlegroup. Fixed values indicate compulsory numbers of certain Squads, while some categories may allow a range.

Weapon Options

All units in a squad must be armed identically, so if one unit choose to replace its weapons, all units in that squad must also do so.



HQ  Frontline  Armour Battlegroup Battlegroup Battlegroup

Unit Special Rules

Access

Shaltari forces use Gates - high tech teleportation devices to transport units safely directly from a mothership to the battlefield. Equally useful - though much less high

tech - are Resistance Drills that create vast tunnel networks under a combat zone before emerging to expel fighters directly into the fight.

Units with this rule are always Transports, and use the normal rules, including which type of units they can transport (indicated by the Transport Value symbol as normal).

Squads that embark into Access units are counted as in **Holding** rather than inside that Transport. To remove a squad from in Holding they simply disembark from any Access unit currently on the board provided their Transport Values match. That means that Squads may embark into one Access unit and disembark from a completely different one!

Embarking and disembarking otherwise follows the usual rules, including a free embark or disembark if an Aerial Transport lands. Units embarking into Access units still cannot exceed the Capacity of that unit, although in real terms this is more to do with how many units can feasibly pass through the access point rather than them actually being  inside .

An Access unit cannot embark more than its Capacity in a single round, nor can it disembark more than its Capacity in a single round.

Units in Holding aren t affected if an Access unit is destroyed, since they re technically not inside them! However, if all

Access units are destroyed there is no way for any in Holding units to return to the game, so they count as destroyed.

Any squads that start the game in Holding must be declared as such. Those squads may only arrive onto the battlefield by disembarking from an Access unit, and are ignored for the purposes of the Aerial Advantage rule. While Access units are never actually  full , the total Requirement capacity of units starting the game in Holding must still cause all Access units to be at least half full (and indeed can

` `overfill  Access units if desired).

Bloodthirsty

Some warriors are almost mindless, highly aggressive creatures that will always focus on slaughtering enemies.

If this unit is in the same Garrison as an enemy unit, then it may not move away or leave the Garrison. This unit suffers a -2 penalty when searching for objectives.

Command Centre

Some vehicles are viable as command centres despite their usual battlefield role.

A Commander can be mounted in this unit as if it had the Command category.

Dodge X+

Preternaturally fast fighters are frequently seen on the battlefield. Sometimes bred specially and sometimes given AI assistance, these warriors are quick enough to avoid blows in close quarters fighting, and even the odd bullet!

This unit gains a Passive Countermeasures save equal to the X value against **Close Quarters weapons and Collateral Damage.** This may be taken in addition to any other Passive Countermeasures save the unit has.


[Special ](#_page41_x0.00_y595.28)[Rules ](#_page3_x0.00_y595.28)[Scenarios ](#_page31_x0.00_y595.28)[YBuilding our Army](#_page39_x0.00_y595.28)[ Rules](#_page41_x0.00_y595.28)

Fast

This unit has two stats on its MV value - a minimum and a maximum. Unlike other units, a Fast unit **has to make a Moving action each activation,** and must

move at least its minimum MV, up to its maximum MV, in a straight line.

**Fast units may only turn on their axis a maximum of 90 degrees after completing their move, and cannot land.**

Due to the speed of these units, it s common for them to travel away from the battlefield. Unlike other units, a Fast unit **can move off the board as part**

**of their move.** If they do so, they re put In Readiness, coming on from the usual point of the table edge for your army in subsequent rounds.

A Fast unit can elect to **fly high** as part

of its Moving action. When flying high, it ignores all Impassable scenery, but cannot make Shooting actions in the same round. If a unit otherwise couldn t complete its move (due to Impassable scenery over 8  being in the way), it **must** fly high.

Unless explicitly mentioned in the scenario special rules, **units with this special rule always begin the game In Reserve, and are ignored for determining Victory Points at any time, but still concede Kill Points.**

Infiltrate X

Certain units are specially trained to sneak onto a battlefield prior to full scale engagement, allowing them to set up in an advantageous position.

Infiltrate units are denoted with a number value. This unit may be Directly Deployed even when the scenario would not normally allow it to do so, ignoring the Aerial Advantage rule. It may deploy

up to the listed number of inches from

a friendly table edge. Infantry with this special rule may deploy directly into a Garrison if within range. The rest of this unit s Battlegroup deploys normally, and this unit can make actions even if the rest of its Battlegroup are In Readiness or In Reserve.

A unit deploying using this rule cannot deploy in a Transport, but a Transport with this rule confers it to any units deployed in it.

Large

Battlefields are large and dangerous places, which necessitate large and dangerous war machines and creatures.

This unit cannot be Hull Down.

Rapid Insertion X

Highly trained special forces soldiers are adept at dropping rapidly down to Terra Firma from an airborne dropship and into the fray with lethal speed, surprise, and aggression. They most often carry breaching charges or similar in order to make their arrival as quick and surprising as possible.

This unit may disembark from Aerial Transports that haven t landed. Some units with this rule will have a number listed after. That is the number of inches further than normal an Aerial Transport they re embarked in can move and still disembark this unit (up to its maximum MV value).

They may also disembark straight into a Garrison from any direction (including the roof if the Aerial Transport is on top of it!), regardless of whether it has an entrance point.

Additionally, if this unit shoots with Close Quarters weapons in the turn it enters a Garrison via this rule, it doesn t have to re-roll successful damage rolls.

Rare

You may only take a maximum of one of each type of Rare squad in a Skirmish sized game, two of each type in a Clash, and three of each type in a Battle. This restriction applies to each Rare squad individually (you may take two **different** types of Rare squads in a Skirmish for example).

Resilient

Whether through dispersed formations, hardened armour, or simply toughened creatures, some fighters or vehicles are simply harder to hurt!

A unit with this special rule is immune to Critical hits. They instead act just like normal hits, doing a single point of damage.

Wide

Some units are familiar with active fighting far away from any allies, completing objectives on their own with limited support.

This unit doubles the usual distance of its coherency.

Weapon Special Rules

Alternate Fire (ALT X)

Some weapons have multiple fire modes

- concentrated and wide energy beams, or anti-tank and anti-air modes, to name but a few.

This weapon is represented by more than one weapon profile. Weapons with the same ALT-X number can only fire one profile each round.

Anti-Aircraft (AA X)

These are weapons specifically designed to shoot down aircraft via advanced tracking mechanics.

**AA weapons are the only weapons able to target Aircraft.** AA weapons may target other units as normal.

AA weapons are denoted with a number after them. This number modifies the target s Evasion Countermeasures by the amount listed.

For example a weapon with AA -2 targeting an enemy unit with E+3 would reduce it to E+1.

In addition, AA weapons can **Reaction Fire.**

If an enemy Aircraft squad makes a Moving action within range and line

of sight of an AA weapon that has not shot this round, declare that the unit

will Reaction Fire. The unit immediately makes an out of sequence Shooting action at the enemy Aircraft squad with an AA weapon. Reaction Fire can be declared before an aircraft lands. Weapons shot in Reaction Fire follow all the normal rules (M&F, disembarking etc) and cannot shoot again during the round, although the unit may still make two actions that round when Reaction Firing as normal.

Measure line of sight and range to the enemy squad as normal, measuring to any point along its movement path. Note that this means a squad may Reaction Fire at a Fast Aircraft that has moved off the board, doing damage before it leaves.

Multiple units may choose to Reaction Fire against the same enemy Aircraft after the same move, simply declare and resolve each unit one by one.

**Reaction Fire is by its very nature somewhat less accurate than a well considered flurry, and as such suffers a +2 penalty to its Accuracy.** AA weapons that also have the Indirect Fire special rule may not Reaction Fire.

57
[Special ](#_page41_x0.00_y595.28)[Rules ](#_page3_x0.00_y595.28)[Scenarios ](#_page31_x0.00_y595.28)[YBuilding our Army](#_page39_x0.00_y595.28)[ Rules](#_page41_x0.00_y595.28)

Area (Area)

This weapon uses the Blast template - a round marker with a diameter of 4 .

Roll to hit with the weapon following normal targeting rules.

If the weapon hits, place the centre of the Blast template over the centre of the body of the target unit. Any unit (friendly or enemy) at least partially touched by the template gets hit automatically. Roll to damage separately for each unit hit, following the normal rules.

If the roll to hit is a 1, the weapon misses.

If the roll to hit misses on any other number, the weapon glances its target. Do not place the template. Instead only the target unit is hit, and the weapon suffers -2 Energy.

Area weapons targeting a Behemoth or scenery piece lose the Area rule for that shot. Behemoths and scenery pieces touched by a Blast template are unaffected.

**Infantry units hit by an Area weapon instead suffer D6 hits, and Destructible scenery pieces suffer D3 hits.**

When targeting Infantry against an edge

of a Garrison, do not place the template. Instead, all units on that edge are hit (for D6 hits as above). An infantry unit on the edge of a Garrison that is touched by the template but not the target of the Shooting action is not hit.

Area weapons with multiple Shots or squads with multiple area weapons place all of the blast markers at the same time, although can place them on different units in the same squad. Resolve hits and damage for each blast marker simultaneously.

Area weapons with the AA special rule may target Aircraft as normal, but only other Aircraft can be hit by the Blast template.

Articulated

Some vehicles (most notably UCM battle tanks) feature folding turrets which have been designed to fire over low obstructions, improving visibility while simultaneously protecting the vehicle s hull.

Line of sight may be measured from a point 1  above the hull when firing an Articulated weapon.

Cover [X]

Whether pinpoint accurate sniper rifles or radiation-emitting microwave cannons, some weapons can pass through even the toughest of cover.

Cover weapons can have up to four keywords denoted: **Soft, Body, Hull and All**. Weapons with Soft ignore Soft Cover, weapons with Body ignore Body Cover, weapons with Hull ignore Hull Down, and weapons with All ignore all cover!

Destroyer (DS X+)

Some powerful weapons are designed

to specifically destroy heavily armoured vehicles through targeting weak spots in the armour with pinpoint accuracy.

A Destroyer weapon is denoted by a DS with a number after it.

If a Destroyer weapon hits its target by rolling equal to or higher than the X value shown, it automatically causes a Critical hit without needing to roll for damage.

If a shooter s Accuracy is modified above the X value, it still misses as normal, the X value instead becoming the lowest number required to hit - in this instance any hit would automatically become a Destroyer hit!

Passive Countermeasures may still be used against Destroyer hits.


[Special ](#_page41_x0.00_y595.28)[Rules ](#_page3_x0.00_y595.28)[Scenarios ](#_page31_x0.00_y595.28)[YBuilding our Army](#_page39_x0.00_y595.28)[ Rules](#_page41_x0.00_y595.28)

Devastator (DV-X [X])

Devastator weapons are designed specifically to deal with the toughest enemies and structures, and normally feature explosive warheads which detonate after penetration.

This weapon is denoted by a DV with a number and keywords after it.

When a Devastator weapon hits a target with the type in brackets, roll to damage as normal. However, **it instead does the amount of damage listed by the**

**X value.** If this weapon scores a natural Critical, multiply the X value by 2!

For example a weapon with DV-3 (Behemoths) hits a Behemoth once. Roll one dice to Damage as normal. If successful, the Behemoth in fact takes three Damage!

This special rule may target particular unit types (such as Infantry, Vehicles etc), or even types of scenery pieces. It may even affect every type of unit, denoted by  All . Sometimes a Devastator weapon has more than one value for different types of units, and sometimes a unit can be affected by multiple types (such as a Large Vehicle for example). In this situation, simply pick the highest applicable number.

Note that if a weapon is **Devastator (Scenery), on a Critical the damage isn t multiplied by 2** and it still only receives 1 Collateral Damage token.

Flame

Flame weapons have been seen on the battlefield for millennia, primarily used for clearing out dug in positions.

These weapons may target enemy Infantry that are in Garrisons, whether they have moved to an edge or not. Simply target the edge of a Garrison as if they were on that edge.

Units in Garrisons occupied by friendly Infantry can be targeted by Flame weapons, however **any missed shots are counted as successful hits against one of those friendly units,** allocated by the target s player.

**Neither Body Cover nor Soft Cover can be used against Flame weapons, and they ignore Evasion Countermeasures.**

Additionally, every time a Flame weapon targets an Infantry unit inside a Garrison or a Destructible scenery piece, the scenery piece receives **1 additional Collateral Damage token,** regardless of how much damage is done. If that scenery piece has the Flammable rule, it receives 2 additional Collateral Damage tokens instead.

Focus X

Weapons can sometimes combine fire to become something greater than the sum

of their parts - achieving higher power and stopping power against well-armoured targets.

Focus weapons are denoted with a number after them.

After rolling to hit, you can choose to discard any number of hits from a single Focus weapon and add the X number to the Energy value of one or more of the remaining shots.

For example, a unit of Scourge Warriors fires their Plasma Rifles with Focus-3. They hit with 4 shots. The player decides to discard

2 of the shots to turn the Energy of the remaining 2 shots from 3 to 6. Alternatively they could discard 3 of the shots so the 1 remaining shot fires at a massive Energy 12!

Indirect

An Indirect weapon may draw line of sight from a friendly **Scout** unit instead

of its own unit - simply check line of sight as normal from the Scout unit instead. This might mean targets are Hull Down - following the normal rules (judging from the Scout unit instead).

An Indirect weapon can instead choose to target an enemy squad that it (or any friendly Scout units) cannot draw line

of sight to. If it does so, **its Accuracy becomes 5+ before modifiers** (even when targeting Scenery pieces). When firing in this way, the target does **not** count as Hull Down, but can benefit from Soft or Body Cover as normal.

Limited X

Some weapons may only be fired a number of times before they run out of ammunition.

A weapon with Limited uses is denoted by an L with a number by it.

The number is the number of times that weapon can be used for a Shooting action in a game. After that it cannot be used again.

Penetrative (P)

Some weapons are able to penetrate armour much thicker than they would otherwise be effective against by careful application of force or particularly accurate shots, such as shaped charge explosions or anti-materiel rifles.

Penetrative weapons always do damage to targets on a damage roll of 6.

Reduced X

Infantry squads can bring formidable fire to bear, although each casualty reduces their battlefield effectiveness.

A Reduced weapon is denoted with a number by it.

Every time the unit with the weapon loses 1 Damage Point, reduce the Shots characteristic of the weapon by the number listed.

A weapon with this special rule may instead combine its fire. For that attack it reduces its Shots characteristic to 1 and increases its Energy by 1 for every Shot removed (after reducing the Shots due to damage taken), **to a maximum of 9.**

If **not** a Close Quarters Weapon, this combined fire can gain the AA rule

for that action, although if doing so it **reduces its R(F) and R(C) ranges to 6 .** Note that the same restrictions apply to shooting at Aircraft as normal, such as being unable to do so if the squad disembarked from an Aerial Transport.

Strafe (Strafe-X)

Some weapons have such colossal fire output that they can tear through entire regiments

or armoured companies in a single volley.

Strafe weapons are denoted with a number by them. When making a Shooting action, this weapon can be fired the number of times listed, but each must be fired at units within 3  of at least one other targeted unit. You can target the same unit multiple times. Declare all targets before rolling to hit as normal.

Structural

Weapons with the Structural special rule cannot be affected by Crippled results unless specifically mentioned.

Tech Killer

Devastating against enemy armour and infantry alike, these weapons have little to no effect on structures.

A Tech Killer weapon cannot damage scenery pieces.
